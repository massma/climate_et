## Notes of the week 2017-09-11 ##

The big question is how do we calculate the error, or strucutre of the error, for the pseudo-LAI term? Assume this is constant on some timescale and then fit a noise distribution (f(latent vars) given the data?

And, LAI really does not seem to be a function of SWC, so how does SWC really enter into all of this?

After making some plots it seems like SWC enters into it through VPD and temperature (via Delta). Both VPD and Delta are negatively correlated wtih SWC, so for increasing SWC these will decrease. Both are on the denominator of the function, sot his means that d ET/ DVPD will increase as SWC increases.

Also, note that LAI seems to be strongly a function of jd, which is physical for plants with a strong growing season.

LAI is also a strong funciton of hour of day. I have less of a physical explanation for this, and maybe this means that there is some error that is f(hour).

Should we try to remove the daily cycle? It seems like it dominates the signal of the data.
