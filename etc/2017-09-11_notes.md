## Notes of the week 2017-09-11 ##

The big question is how do we calculate the error, or strucutre of the error, for the pseudo-LAI term? Assume this is constant on some timescale and then fit a noise distribution (f(latent vars) given the data?

And, LAI really does not seem to be a function of SWC, so how does SWC really enter into all of this.
