### These are in response to new physical, analytical approach ###

This si really cool and much more in line with my initial gut feeling that stomatal VPD will dominate. I think this is opposite to what most hydrometerologists think (I actually love showing results that are opposite to preconceived notions). Since you have the analytical ET, you can also compute the GPP dependence. People always believe it is decreasing GPP but I think on the low VPD end it should actually increase it (not much stress but more demand).
And even better you can look at WUE as well to wrap this up.
I am free most of next week except on Monday (will be in my office).
Here are the stability corrections I typically use, which work well.
PS: nice derivation

You mentioned that there is no soil moisture dependence but it does not to be what we are seeing. In fact the VPD dependence becomes quite strong at higher soil moisture value (BTW it would be really interesting to define a sensitivity of ET and GPP to soil moisture vs VPD but normalized otherwise we cannot say which one is important, might be a nice follow up).
PS: I am starting some work on diurnal cycle and hysteresis. I think you will find that interesting.
