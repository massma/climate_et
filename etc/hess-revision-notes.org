I think for the revision we should do a major rewrite. Just present
the derivation, then present a single figure of 9 curves, represented
25, 50 and 75 percentiles for g1, uWUE, and the scaling term. We could
even take these directly from the literature. The scaling term could
come from the data though.

Then we could show okay, what if there are structural differences in
the functional form?

Then we can conclude by saying, okay, we really do not know what the
et response is to vpd, and if we can't understand the response to a
single isolated change, how can we ever know the reponse when many
things are changing at once?

This I think puts the focus where it should be: we really don't know
the response and we need to focus our research on understanding these
things. Makes it more into a discussion/review paper, but could still
be interesting.
