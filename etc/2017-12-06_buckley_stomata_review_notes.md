Note that in reality the stomatal response to dryness is to open for 10-15 min, then close over the next 20-75 min, at which point they reach a steady state.

Epidermal turgor decreases with increasing atm VPD, and increases in P_e causes a decrease in a_s, so this means that an increase in VPD causes an increase in gs, which is not what we expect.

Epidermis has more mechanical advantage than the guard cell. Hypthesis one for two stage response is both turgor pressures decrease equally causing stomatal opening, which induces a stronger decrease in guard cell turgor which closes them up again.

## My questions: ##

Do stomata reponde to perturbations of humidity or absolute values? My model assumes absolute values. Similiar patterns for perturbations at the roots: wrong response for 5-10 min, followed by correct resons e for 30-60 min.


What does this mean:
"The fact that stomata respond similarly to local variations in epidermal turgor that are too small to change bulk leaf water potential suggests that the sensor is close to guard cells, perhaps in the epidermis."

Uh oh:

"Furthermore, Mott & Parkhurst (1991) demonstrated that stomata are insensitive to ambient humidity per se."
