Here are notes about finding site information regarding grass type, and whether crops are irrigated or not. Also just a refresher in generalk C3 are temperature plants, and C4 are tropical plants. 

### Grass ###

* uWUE is only provided in Zho for generic grass... no specification of C3 vs C4. So we can start with grass and just let mean sigma determine how uWUE varies with C3 cs C4. Another more broad question is whether it is more reasonable to use mean or median sigma for new uWUE.... the skewness of the distribution might make the median a better choice as "most likely" parameter.

* Lin (via Franks) provides different coefficients for C3 and C4 (and note that they are very different).

* So now we just need to figure out which sites are C3 and which are C4. 

### Crops ###

* No mention in Zhou about irrigation.

* g1 from Lin (via Franks) specifies crops as C3


### Other Notes ###

Also note that if we want to be really thorough (at the cost of complexity and sample size) we could subset the tree sites in angio, gymno and savannah. There are published g1 coefficents in Lin for this.
