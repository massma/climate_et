\section{Methods}
\label{methods}
The Penman-Monteith equation \citep [hereafter PM,][]{Penman_1948,
  Monteith_1965} estimates ET as a function of observable atmospheric
variables and surface conductances:
% \begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
    \label{orig_pen}
    ET = \frac{\Delta R_{net} + g_a \rho_a c_p VPD}{\Delta + \gamma(1 + \frac{g_a}{g_s})},
  \end{equation}
% \end{linenomath*}
where $\Delta$ is the change in saturation vapor pressure with
temperature, given by Clausius-Clapeyron ($\frac{d \; e_s}{d \; T}$),
$R_{net}$ is the net radiation minus ground heat flux, $g_a$ is
aerodynamic conductance, $\rho_a$ is air density, $c_p$ is specific
heat of air at constant pressure, $\gamma$ is the psychometric
constant, and $g_s$ is the stomatal conductance (Table
\ref{definitions}). The issue with PM is that $g_s$ is a function of
carbon uptake, which is has a strong functionally relation to ET
through stomatal function. Therefore, when PM is formulated in terms
of $g_s$, it is an implicit funciton of ET as a function of itself
rather than an explicit function of ET. Here we will derive a new form
of PM in which ET is an explicit function of plant parameters and
environmental conditions, and use it to assess the ecosystem scale
response to VPD (by taking a partial derivative).

\citet{MEDLYN_2011} developed a model for stomatal conductance ($g_s$)
by combining an optimal photosynthesis theory \citep{Cowan_1977} with an empirical approach, which describes the
dependence of $g_s$ to VPD. This resulted in the following model for
leaf-scale stomatal conductance:

% \begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
    g_{s-leaf} = g_0 + 1.6 \left(1 +
      \frac{g_{1-leaf}}{\sqrt{VPD}}\right) \frac{A}{c_a},
    \label{leaf_medlyn}
  \end{equation}
% \end{linenomath*}
where $g_{1-leaf}$ is a leaf-scale ``slope'' parameter, A is the net
CO$_2$ assimilation rate, and $c_a$ is the atmospheric CO$_2$
concentration at the leaf surface. \cite{MEDLYN_2011} relate the slope
parameter ($g_{1-leaf}$) to physical parameters as:
% \begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
    g_{1-leaf} = \sqrt{\frac{3 \, \Gamma^* \,
        \lambda}{1.6}},\footnote{Note this expression has units of of
      (mmol mol$^{-1}$)$^{1/2}$, but this can be converted to
      Pa$^{1/2}$ using the ideal gas law.}
    \label{slope}
  \end{equation}
% \end{linenomath*}

where $\Gamma^*$ is the CO$_2$ compensation point for photosynthesis
(without dark respiration), and $\lambda$ is the marginal water cost
of leaf carbon
($\frac{\partial \; \text{transpiration}}{\partial \; A}$)
\citep{Farquhar_1980, Katul_2009}. So,
$g_{1-leaf}$ is a leaf-scale term reflecting the trade-off of water for
carbon uptake. The higher $g_{1-leaf}$, the more open the stomata and
the more they release water in exchange for carbon.


The Medlyn model adopted to ecosystem scale analysis in
\citet{Medlyn_2017}. In units of m s$^{-1}$, the ecosystem scale
stomatal conductance is:

% \begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
    g_s = \frac{R \,T}{P} \; 1.6 \left(1 + \frac{g_1}{\sqrt{VPD}}\right) \frac{GPP}{c_a},
    \label{medlyn}
  \end{equation}
% \end{linenomath*}

  where GPP is the ecosystem scale gross primary production, and $g_1$
  is an ecosystem scale analogue to $g_{1-leaf}$.

  While Eq. (\ref{medlyn}) can be used in PM (Eq. (1)), it will make
  analytical work with the function intractable because $GPP$ is
  functionally related to ET itself. Additionally, a perturbation to
  VPD should induce a physiological plant response that will alter GPP
  and cause an indirect change in stomatal conductance, in addition to
  the direct effect of VPD in Eq. (\ref{medlyn}). Therefore, in order
  to derive the response of ET to VPD, we must account for the
  functional relationship between GPP, ET, and VPD, and its effect on
  stomatal conductance. We can use aforementioned semi-empirical
  results of \citet{Zhou_2015}, which were inspired optimal
  photosynthesis theory, as a tool to approach this
  problem. \citet{Zhou_2015}, showed that underlying Water Use
  Efficiency (uWUE):

% \begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
    uWUE = \frac{GPP \cdot \sqrt{VPD}}{ET}
    \label{uwue}
  \end{equation}
% \end{linenomath*}

  is relatively constant across time within a plant functional type,
  and correctly captures a constant relationship between GPP, ET and
  VPD over a diurnal cycle during the growing season
  \citep{Zhou_2014}. The theoretical derivation of the square root VPD
  dependence in $uWUE$ leverages the same assumptions used in
  \cite{MEDLYN_2011} to derive the square-root VPD dependence of the
  stomatal conductance model (Eq.  (\ref{medlyn})).  We can use uWUE
  to remove the $GPP$ dependence from $g_s$ in a way that makes PM
  analytically tractable:

% \begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
    g_s = \frac{R \, T}{P} 1.6 \left(1 + \frac{g_1}{\sqrt{VPD}}\right) \frac{uWUE \; ET}{c_a \; \sqrt{VPD}}.
    \label{new_g_s}
  \end{equation}
% \end{linenomath*}

Plugging Eq. (\ref{new_g_s}) into Eq. (\ref{orig_pen}) and
rearranging gives a new explicit expression for PM, in which
dependence on $GPP$ is removed:

% \begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
    ET = \frac{\Delta R_{net} + \frac{g_a\; P}{T} \left( \frac{ c_p VPD}{R_{air}} -  \frac{\gamma c_a \sqrt{VPD} }{ R \; 1.6\; \text{ uWUE } (1 + \frac{g_1}{\sqrt{VPD}})} \right) }{ \Delta + \gamma}
    \label{et}
  \end{equation}
% \end{linenomath*}

  By accounting for photosynthesis changes in ecosystem conductance,
  with Eq. (\ref{et}) we have used recent results
  \citep[][]{MEDLYN_2011, Zhou_2014, Zhou_2015, Medlyn_2017} to derive
  ET explicitly as function of environmental variables and two
  plant-specific constants, the slope parameter ($g_1$), and uWUE. For
  the first time we have removed the implicit dependence of ET on
  itself through the stomatal conductance term, and we have also
  replaced the added complexity of a stomatal conductance reduction
  factor and a photosythesis model with a signle paramter (uWUE). Both
  the plant paramters reflect water conservation strategy.The
  slope parameter is related to the willingness of stomata to trade
  water for CO$_2$ and to keep stomata open (carbon cost in terhms of
  water)). uWUE is a semi-empirical ecosystem-scale constant related
  to how WUE changes with VPD (specifically $VPD^{-1/2}$). It is also
  roughly proportional to physical constants:

\[uWUE \appropto \sqrt{\frac{c_a - \Gamma}{1.6 \lambda}},\]

where $\Gamma$ is the CO$_2$ compensation point \citep[Eq. (5)
in][]{Zhou_2014}. So uWUE is related to atmospheric CO$_2$
concentration and compensation point, and is inversely proportional to
the marginal water cost of leaf carbon.


With Equation \ref{et} we can take the partial derivative of ET with respect
to VPD to understand whether VPD drives or reduces ecosystem-scale ET:

% \begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial \;  ET}{\partial \; VPD} = \frac{2\; g_a \;
      P}{T(\Delta + \gamma)}   \left(\frac{ c_p}{R_{air}} -
      \frac{\gamma c_a }{1.6 \; R\; \; \text{ uWUE }} \left(
        \frac{2 g_1 + \sqrt{VPD}}{2 (g_1 + \sqrt{VPD})^2}\right)
    \right),
    \label{d_et}
  \end{equation}
% \end{linenomath*}

  deriving an analytical framework for ecosystem response to
  atmospheric demand with environmental conditions held
  fixed. There are a few subtleties to taking the derivative in
  Eq. (\ref{d_et}): $\Delta$ ($\frac{d e_{s}}{d T}$) and $VPD$ are
  functionally related, so while taking the derivative we evaluate
  $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD} = \frac{\partial \; ET}
  {\partial \; e_s} \frac{\partial \; e_s}{\partial \; VPD}
  \Big|_{\text{RH fixed}} + \frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; RH}
  \frac{\partial \; RH}{\partial \; VPD} \Big|_{\text{$e_s$
      fixed}}$. $RH$ and $e_s$ are assumed to be approximately
  independent, which is supported by data (not shown).

  This derivation relied either implicitly or explicitly on several
  assumptions. First, we assume that VPD at the leaf surface is the
  same as VPD at measurement height; physically this implies that
  leaves are perfectly coupled to the atmosphere. In reality, for some
  conditions and plant types the leaves can become decoupled from the
  boundary layer \citep{De_2017, Medlyn_2017}. Therefore, our
  derivation will be most applicable in times like the growing season
  (when we also expect uWUE to be most valid), when relatively high
  insolation induces instability and convective boundary layers, and
  we would expect the surface to be generally well coupled. An
  additional assumption in the formulation of $uWUE$ \citep{Zhou_2014,
    Zhou_2015} and \citet{Medlyn_2017}'s stomatal conductance model is
  that direct soil evaporation (E) contributions to ET remain small
  relative to transpiration (T). Again, this should be more true
  during the growing season. The ratio of E to T may increase
  immediately after rainfall events due to high soil moisture and
  ponding, but VPD is generally low anyways during these
  times. However, some plant types allow for systematically larger
  contributions of E in ET, particularly those with sparse canopies
  and smaller relative amounts of transpiration. We therefore might
  expect that the theory will be most applicable to forest PFTs, which
  will be most strongly coupled to the boundary layer due to larger
  surface roughness, and will also generally have the highest ratios
  of transpiration to evaporation. Finally, we assume that $g_1$ and
  $uWUE$ are constant with respect to the conceptual VPD
  perturbation. Both quantities have been shown to be relatively
  constant with respect to changes in
  VPD \citep{Franks_2017, Zhou_2014}. These parameters will however
  vary with plant species and characteristics \citep[e.g. wood density,
  ][]{Lin_2015}, as well as environmental conditions including soil
  water content \citep{Manzoni2013} and temperature.

  As Eq. (\ref{d_et}) is a partial derivative, it's utility is as a
  conceptual model for the change in ET in response to VPD with all
  other variables held fixed. This concept is a useful tool for
  identifying the effect of VPD on ET through atmospheric demand and
  plant response, and allows a practitioner to disentangle complicated
  feedbacks when many quantities co-vary. However users of
  Eq. (\ref{d_et}) should take care that their interpretation matches
  the assumptions inherent in a partial derivative. For example,
  results will only be as valid as the assumption that g$_1$ and uWUE
  (and by extension $\lambda$) are fixed with respect to the user's
  conceptual change in VPD. Fortunately, these quantities are
  relatively constant for many under many scenarios
  \citep{Franks_2017}. Care must also be taken with possible indirect
  effects associated with a change in VPD: for example, a change in ET
  induced by a change in VPD can cause a change in surface
  temperature, which would drive a change in net radiation. These
  types of indirect effects and feedbacks are not considered in
  Eq. (\ref{d_et}): temperature (a variable) is mathematically fixed.

  To account for both the variability in plant parameters and the
  environment, we will systematically analyze how the ET response to
  VPD (Eq. (\ref{d_et})) varies. Equation (\ref{d_et}) includes a
  ``sign'' term that determines the sign of the response in addition
  to magnitude:



  ** comment on temperature and acclimation??? **
  ** impact of T is much smaller than VPD? **
  ** paragraph on soil moisture **

\begin{equation}
  \label{sign}
  \frac{c_p}{R_{air}} - \frac{\gamma c_a }{1.6 \; R\; \text{ uWUE }} \left( \frac{2 g_1 + \sqrt{VPD}}{2 (g_1 + \sqrt{VPD})^2}\right),
\end{equation}

and a ``scaling'' term multiplying the ``sign'' term:

\begin{equation}
  \frac{g_a \; P}{T(\Delta + \gamma)}.
\end{equation}

In the ``sign term'' most of the quantities are relatively constant,
except for VPD and the plant parameters g$_1$ and uWUE. In the scaling
term, most of the terms are relatively constant with the exception of
aerodynamic conductance ($g_a$) and temperature (especially its effect
through $\Delta$). To determine the range of probable ET responses to
VPD we will systematically vary these parameters according to Table
\ref{param_varying}, while all other parameters are held fixed (Table
\ref{param_fixed}). Physical variables ($g_a$, $T$) and plant
physiological parameters (g$_1$, uWUE) are varied according to
literature-based expectations for a range of growing season conditions
and plant types \citep{Zhou_2015, Medlyn_2017}. Using this previous
literature we can connect the effect of varying plant parameters to
specific plant types and characteristics.

\section{Results}
\label{results}

By varying four parameters (g$_a$, T, uWUE, g$_1$) at three different
values (Table \ref{param_varying}) we generate nine different values
for the scaling term, nine different curves (as a function of VPD) for
the sign term, and 81 different curves for the ET response to VPD
($\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$). To aid visualization we
can examine a subset of nine of these 81 curves, defined by the
minimum, median and maximum values for both the scaling and sign term
(Figure \ref{full}). The range of ET responses to VPD vary from those
where ET almost always decreases with increasing VPD (water
conservative), to those where ET almost always increases with
increasing VPD (water intensive). Additionally, for some parameters
whether ET will increase or decrease with increasing VPD depends on
atmospheric demand (Figure \ref{full}).

\begin{figure}
  \centering \includegraphics{./fully_idealized.pdf}
  \caption{The functional form of $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial
      \; VPD}$ for minimum, median and maximum values of both the sign
    term and the scaling term.}

\end{figure}

  \caption{The functional form of $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial
      \; VPD}$ evaluated at the median value of the scaling term, for
    varying values of g$_1$ and uWUE as given in Table \ref{param_varying}.}
  \label{sign}
\end{figure}

Examining the sign term independent of the scaling term illuminates
the role of the two plant parameters, g$_1$ and uWUE, in determining
the degree to which the response is water conservative
($\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD} < 0$) or water intensive
($\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD} > 0$) (Figure \ref{sign})
. Higher g$_1$ and uWUE shift the curve towards increasing ET
responses with VPD (water intensive), and smaller g$_1$ values lead to
a higher non-linear VPD dependence of the response. g$_1$ and uWUE
should generally co-vary with $\lambda$. As $\lambda$ increases, g$_1$
should increase and uWUE should decrease. ** ellaborate **

\begin{figure}
  \centering \includegraphics{./fully_idealized_scaling.pdf}

      \; VPD}$ evaluated at the median value of the sign term, for
    varying values of g$_a$ and T as given in Table \ref{param_varying}.}
  \label{scaling}
\end{figure}

Examining the scaling term independent of the sign term shows how
aerodynamic conductance (communication between the atmosphere and the
surface) and temperature (controls the efficiency of energy conversion
to latent heat through $\Delta$), amplify or suppress the plant
response represented in the sign term (Figure \ref{scaing}). Both
lower temperatures and higher aerodynamic conductance lead to
amplified ET response to VPD, with the variability of aerodynamic
conductance resulting in a slightly higher variability of ET response
relative to temperature.

\section{Discussion}
\label{discussion}

Interpreting both the derivation and results of this manuscript hinges
on an understanding and appreciation for the usefulness of partial
derivatives for understanding the behavior of complex systems in a
simplifed framework. Our results are a conceptual tool for answering
the question, ``What is the ET response to VPD with all other
quantities held fixed?'' This is useful, and we would argue is
critical, for understanding complex responses when many quantities are
varying simultaneously \citep{Zhou_2019}. If we cannot understand the
contribution of one term to observed variability, independent of other
confounding factors, there is little hope of disentangling and
understanding the relative role of many covarying quantities in
determining observed variability.  Equation \ref{d_et} explicitly
provides an estimate of the ET response to VPD, given assumptions
about ecosystem plant characteristics through the parameters g$_1$ and
uWUE. Eq. (\ref{d_et}) is generic to external environmental factors
and the timescale over which a VPD response acts, and has a
straightforward conceptual interpretation. It provides the ET
response, given other quantities and parameters held fixed, subject to
the assumptions outlined in Sect. \ref{methods}. So, while the plant
parameters g$_1$ and uWUE may vary with plant species and
environmental conditions like soil moisture, we can still assess the
ET response to VPD for a given plant species, or for a given soil
moisture condition. ** talk about uWUE-SM, with supplementary here **?

However, given that g$_1$ and uWUE can vary, and they both have a
large impact on the ET response (Figure \ref{full}, \ref{sign}), it is
useful to examine how these quantities vary in previous literature,
framed by our results on $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$. In
\citet{Zhou_2015} most plant types have uWUE similar to our median
value, under which the sign of the ET response depends on
VPD. However, crops, which we expect to prioritize carbon uptake over
water conservation, have a higher uWUE value closer to our maximum
value. This higher uWUE results in a higher likelihood for an
increasing ET response to VPD, which matches intuition given that we
expect crops to keep stomata open for access to carbon, at the cost of
increased water loss during high VPD. Shrubs, and to a lesser extent
grass, have an uWUE closer to the minimum uWUE. For these plant types,
we would then expect a decrease of ET in response to VPD. It is
important to note that, while \citet{Zhou_2015} did not examine the
role of soil moisture for within plant-type variability of uWUE, we
might expect some variation, especially in extreme cases when soil
water becomes a limiting factor. ** talk about uWUE-SM, with supplementary here **?

\citet{Medlyn_2017}'s results did not display the robust relationship
between plant type and and plant parameter (g$_1$) that was
demontrated by \citet{Zhou_2015} for uWUE. Given that there is a
robust relationship between g$_1$ and plant type in \citet{Lin_2015},
and that \citet{Zhou_2015}'s ecosystem-scale results rely on the same
underlying theory as \citet{Medlyn_2017}'s results, the ambiguous
results in \citet{Medlyn_2017} could be due to noise in ecosystem
scale observations, the consequences of imposing a model structure in
some of their g$_1$ esimations, or real ecosystem-scale within-plant
type variability (e.g. multiple species impacting the relationship
with the eddy-covariance footprint). These differences between
leaf-scale behavior and ecosystem scale behavior highlight the
importance of understanding how and why slope parameters show
increased variability at the ecosystem scale, as argued by
\citet{Medlyn_2017}. However, if we assume that there is some real
analogy between leaf scale results in \citet{Lin_2015} and ecosystem
scale behavior, and that some of the ambiguity in \citet{Medlyn_2017}
is due to model and/or observational error, then we can g$_1$-induced
ET response variability and plant characteristics, which are subject
to the strong caveat that we still do not fully understand g$_1$
behavior at the ecosystem scale. Extrapolating \citet{Lin_2015}'s
results (e.g. Fig. 2) to the ecosystem scale would reveal the
following relationships between g$_1$ and plant types:

\begin{itemize}
  \item C3 plants would have a generally higher g$_1$ than C4 plants,
  \item Crops would have a larger g$_1$ than shrubs, grass, and
    angiosperm trees, which have a higher g$_1$ than gymnosperm
    trees.
  \item Tropical and temperate climates would generally be
    characterized by plants with a higher g$_1$ than arctic and boreal
    climates.
\end{itemize}
For all of the above relationships, a higher g$_1$ means a higher
likelihood of a positive ET response to increasing VPD (water
intensive), and a smaller VPD dependence of the ET response.

Our theoretical results highlight the variability of ET
response to VPD as a function of both climate  and plant
characteristics, especially water usage strategy. Whether an
ecosystem increases or decreases ET in response to VPD will vary
depending on vegetation and climate. Generalizations about ET response
to VPD therefore require thoughtful consideration of ecosystem
characteristics; statements such as ``ET increases with warming due to
increases in VPD'' may be false depending on the water conservation
strategy of a given ecosystem \citep{Lemordant_2018}.

Additionally, the sensitivity of ET response to plant parameters
highlights the importance of understanding and developing stomatal
conductance models and parameters for the ecosystem scale. In
particular, why and how g$_1$ behavior at the leaf scale is not
analagous to the ecosystem scale must be understood. While the
derivation here was explicit about the assumption of a constant g$_1$
term with respect to the VPD perturbation, many sophisticated land
surface models and earth system models employing stomatal conductance
models make similar, and even stronger assumptions about the
stationarity of VPD slope terms \citep{Niu_2011, Franks_2017,
  Rogers_2017, Lawrence_2019}. Many models will assume a constant
g$_1$ term within a given plant functional type, and research derived
from these models often does not acknowledge limitations of this
assumption, or the difficulty in the literature with quantifying an
ecosystem scale slope parameter \citep{Medlyn_2017}. Given that
something so fundamental as the ET response to VPD varies strongly
with g$_1$, we must invest more in understanding g$_1$'s behavior at
the ecosystem scale, and the efficacy of models using g$_1$'s for
ecosystem-scale fluxes. Fortunately, our framework, and the novel
approach of using robust ecosystem-scale ratios (uWUE) to remove the
implicit dependence of stomatal conductance on ET, is flexible enough
to be applied to any stomatal conductance model that contains a
dependence on GPP.

So far we have discussed the role of different parameters in
modulating the ET response. However, the form of the ET response is
imposed by our choice of stomatal conductance model. We now examine
how the stomatal model choice, and specifically the exponent of the
VPD dependence in the stomatal conductance model, can impact the
general form of the ET-VPD relationship. There is a theoretical basis
for the square root VPD dependence in both the stomatal conductance
model and $uWUE$ based on the assumption that stomata behave to
maximize carbon gain while minimizing water loss, which observations
also generally support \citep{Lloyd_1991, MEDLYN_2011, Lin_2015,
  Zhou_2014, Zhou_2015, Medlyn_2017}. However, some purely empirical
results that fit the exponent of the VPD dependence to data have shown
that it may vary slightly from 1/2, suggesting that stomata, as well
as ecosystem-scale quantities based on stomata theory, may not always
function optimally \citep{Zhou_2015, Lin_2018}. Specifically with
regards to $uWUE$, one would not expect that this ecosystem scale WUE
quantity will respond to VPD exactly analogously to stomata. Direct
soil evaporation's contributions to ET should shift the exponent of
the VPD dependence, especially at conditions of low GPP when we would
expect a systematically larger portion of direct soil evaporation
contributions to ET, because we would also expect lower amounts of
transpiration at low GPP. \citet{Zhou_2015}'s results corroborate
this: they found a mean empirically fit exponential VPD dependence of
0.55, varying slightly from the theoretically optimal value of of 0.5
for AmeriFlux sites. \citet{Lin_2018}'s results also show variance in
the empirical exponent of the VPD dependence of the stomatal
conductance model, but interpretation of this variance is more
difficult as \citet{Lin_2018} do not handle GPP/A dependence of
stomatal conductance in a directly analogous manner to the optimal
theory in \citet{MEDLYN_2011} and \citet{Medlyn_2017}. Regardless,
given that these recent results on the relationship between VPD, GPP,
and ET \citep{MEDLYN_2011, Zhou_2014, Zhou_2015, Medlyn_2017} form the
backbone of our analysis and are what allowed us to derive an explicit
ET expression for the first time (Eq. (\ref{et})), we will analyze if
and how assumptions about the exponent of the VPD dependence impacts
the shape of the ET-VPD dependence. This analysis is also important to
understand whether the choice of stomatal conductance model alters the
fundamental behavior of the ET-VPD relationships, as many commonly
used models utilize a VPD exponent other than the 1/2 suggested by
optimal theory \citep[e.g. ][ which uses an exponent of
1]{Leuning_1990}. It is useful to understand how the choice of model
imposes the functional form of the ET-VPD relationship, given its
fundamental importance for land-atmosphere interactions.


\subsection{Functional form of ET dependence on VPD and its relation
  to the VPD exponent}
\label{functional_form}

The results presented in Sect. \ref{results} indicates that for a
given $uWUE$ and $g_1$, the ET dependence on VPD should be concave
upward. In other words, there should be some local minimum in ET at a
critical VPD$_{crit}$, assuming the scaling and plant terms
(e.g. aerodynamic conductance, $\Delta$, $g_1$ and $uWUE$) are held
fixed. This result warrants further investigation, because to our
knowledge no earlier work has derived the theoretical ecosystem-scale
relationship between ET and VPD while controlling for other
environmental conditions. In particular there is an apparent lack of
consensus over whether the shape of the ET-VPD curve should be concave
upward (our result) or concave downward in the absence of dramatic
water stress. Given that understanding the ET-VPD relationship of the
one-way plant response is fundamental to hypothesizing about any
feedbacks between the land surface and the atmosphere, we analyze why
our derived ET-VPD relationship is concave upward, particularly with
respect to the exponent of VPD dependence in $uWUE$ and the Medlyn
unified stomatal conductance model, as other models and empiracle
results have suggested exponents varying from 1/2 \citep{Leuning_1990,
  Zhou_2015, Lin_2018}.

By introducing $n$, the exponent of VPD in uWUE, and $m$, the exponent
of VPD in the stomatal conductance model, we can free our theory from
assumptions about VPD dependence:
% \begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
    g_s = \frac{R \, T}{P} 1.6 \left(1 + \frac{g*}{VPD^m}\right) \frac{*WUE \; ET}{c_a \; VPD^n},
    \label{m_n}
  \end{equation}
% \end{linenomath*}
where:
\[*WUE = \frac{GPP}{ET}VPD^n,\] and $g*$ is a generic slope parameter
of units $VPD^m$. To determine how the exponent $n$ and $m$ alter the
shape of the ET-VPD dependence we find the roots of the second
derivative of ET, using Eq. (\ref{m_n}) for stomatal conductance
($g_s$), with respect to VPD: \input{d2_solutions.tex} With this
result we have defined the family of curves separating concave up from
concave down ET solutions (Fig. \ref{concave}). These curves are
only functions of the exponent of the VPD dependence and a quantity we
call non-dimensional VPD ($VPD^m/g*$). Several important
relations reveal themselves from Eq. (\ref{curves}):

  \caption{ Solutions corresponding to inflection points between
    concave up and concave down ET-VPD curves (Eq. (\ref{curves}))
    for three specific scenarios. Solutions are defined in terms of a
    non-dimensional VPD ($VPD^m/g_*$), but to aide physical
    interpretation the horizontal axis is additionally provided in terms of dimensionalized VPD assuming $m=1/2$ and
    $g_*=110\; Pa^{1/2}$ (average of all PFT $g_1$). The vertical axis
    has a different interpretation depending on the solution
    curve. For the blue line ($m$ varying), it corresponds to $m$,
    for the orange line ($n$ varying) it corresponds to $n$, and for
    the green line it corresponds to the value of both $n$ and $m$
    ($n=m$). Regions of the parameter space that correspond to
    concave up and concave down results are labeled.}
  \label{concave}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
  \item For optimal behavior (n, m = 1/2) the ET-VPD curve will be
    concave up regardless of the magnitude of the plant constants
    $g_1$ and $uWUE$. Therefore, the general concave up nature of our
    results, given an assumption of optimal behavior, is insensitive
    to plant type.
  \item For all physically possible exponents of VPD dependence ($n,
    m$), whether the solution is concave up or concave down does not
    depend on $uWUE$.
  \item In general, increasing the exponent of VPD dependence for
    either $uWUE*$ or $g_*$ increases the likelihood of a concave down
    result. Additionally, as the exponent of VPD dependence increases
    from the optimum value of 1/2, whether the curve is concave upward
    or concave downward becomes a function of the plant specific slope
    parameter $g_*$, through non-dimensional VPD
    ($VPD^m/g_*$). Because the exponent of the VPD dependencies is
    capable of altering the fundamental shape of ET-VPD dependence,
    future research investment in understanding the exact VPD
    dependence of stomatal conductance, and further reconciliation of
    empirical and theoretical stomatal and ecosystem behavior should
    be prioritized.
\end{itemize}

While it is possible that in the future some other form of
VPD dependence is derived, at present \cite{MEDLYN_2011} and
\cite{Zhou_2014} firmly established n=m=1/2 as the most likely
candidate given current theory and empirical data. Additionally, we
argue that a concave up result matches physical intuition more than a
concave down result. Plants must maintain nutrient and sugar transport
through the phloem and xylem. To accomplish this, stomata must remain
slightly open \citep{De_2013, Nikinmaa_2013, Ryan_2014}. Furthermore,
even if complete stomatal closure were possible, cuticular water loss
and [at the ecosystem-scale] direct soil evaporation are still sources
of ET which increase with VPD, independent of stomatal
closure ** cite katul??? **. Therefore, in the limit as VPD becomes large and we assume
plants are exercising all strategies to reduce ET, any further increase
in VPD should result in an increase in ET through cuticular water loss
and/or direct soil evaporation. This inevitable transition from
conditions when stomata respond strongly to VPD to conditions when
stomata response is asymptoting towards full closure would cause a
concave up ET-VPD curve, which is matched by our theory. In short,
plant response becomes more limited as VPD increases, while
atmospheric demand monotonically increases with VPD, leading to the
 result that atmospheric demand dominates plant response when
atmospheric demand is high.

This analysis allows us to understand the theoretical shape of the ET
response to VPD with environmental conditions held
fixed. Accomplishing this with purely statistical methods applied to
flux observations would be very difficult, given the relatively fast
time scale of plant response and the non-stationarity of [solar
forced] environmental conditions over the relatively coarse (half
hourly) flux estimates (which is required to obtain robust
eddy-covariance statistics). Our results on the shape of the ET-VPD
curve with environmental conditions held fixed can be built upon with
future work examining how changes in VPD and environmental conditions
(e.g. soil water storage) feedback upon one another. In the soil water
storage example, over very long time scales extremely high VPD
perturbations coupled with no precipitation could result in decreases
in soil water storage such that water becomes limiting. This could be
represented by an extension of our framework in which uWUE is allowed
to change with changing SWC. Here, we focus our results by framing
theme with previous literature to build baseline intuition for ET-VPD
dependence.
