The Penman-Monteith equation \citep [hereafter PM,][]{Penman_1948,
  Monteith_1965} estimates ET as a function of observable atmospheric
variables and surface conductances:
% \begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
    \label{orig_pen}
    ET = \frac{\Delta R_{net} + g_a \rho_a c_p VPD}{\Delta + \gamma(1 + \frac{g_a}{g_s})},
  \end{equation}
% \end{linenomath*}
where $\Delta$ is the change in saturation vapor pressure with
temperature, given by Clausius-Clapeyron ($\frac{d \; e_s}{d \; T}$),
$R_{net}$ is the net radiation minus ground heat flux, $g_a$ is
aerodynamic conductance, $\rho_a$ is air density, $c_p$ is specific
heat of air at constant pressure, $\gamma$ is the psychometric
constant, and $g_s$ is the stomatal conductance (Table
\ref{definitions}).

\citet{MEDLYN_2011} developed a model for stomatal conductance ($g_s$)
by combining an optimal photosynthesis theory \citep{Cowan_1977} with an empirical approach, which describes the
dependence of $g_s$ to VPD. This resulted in the following model for
leaf-scale stomatal conductance:

% \begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
    g_{s-leaf} = g_0 + 1.6 \left(1 +
      \frac{g_{1-leaf}}{\sqrt{VPD}}\right) \frac{A}{c_a},
    \label{leaf_medlyn}
  \end{equation}
% \end{linenomath*}
where $g_{1-leaf}$ is a leaf-scale ``slope'' parameter, A is the net
CO$_2$ assimilation rate, and $c_a$ is the atmospheric CO$_2$
concentration at the leaf surface. \cite{MEDLYN_2011} relate the slope
parameter ($g_{1-leaf}$) to physical parameters as:
% \begin{linenomath*}
  \label{slope}
  \begin{equation}
    g_{1-leaf} = \sqrt{\frac{3 \, \Gamma^* \, \lambda}{1.6}},\footnote{Note this expression has units of of (mmol mol$^{-1}$)$^{1/2}$, but this can be converted to Pa$^{1/2}$ using the ideal gas law.}
  \end{equation}
% \end{linenomath*}

where $\Gamma^*$ is the CO$_2$ compensation point for photosynthesis
(without dark respiration), and $\lambda$ is the marginal water cost
of leaf carbon
($\frac{\partial \; \text{transpiration}}{\partial \; A}$). So,
$g_{1-leaf}$ is a leaf-scale term reflecting the trade-off of water for
carbon uptake. The higher $g_{1-leaf}$, the more open the stomata and
the more they release water in exchange for carbon.


The Medlyn model for stomatal conductance has been shown to behave
very well across PFTs \citep[][]{Lin_2015}, and has been successfully
adopted to ecosystem scale analysis in \citet{Medlyn_2017}. In units
of m s$^{-1}$, the ecosystem scale stomatal conductance is:

% \begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
    g_s = \frac{R \,T}{P} \; 1.6 \left(1 + \frac{g_1}{\sqrt{VPD}}\right) \frac{GPP}{c_a},
    \label{medlyn}
  \end{equation}
% \end{linenomath*}

  where GPP is the ecosystem scale gross primary production, and $g_1$
  is an ecosystem scale analogue to $g_{1-leaf}$. We solve for $g_1$
  following \citet{Medlyn_2017} (Eq. (5)), and take the median $g_1$
  value to be representative of each PFT (Table \ref{pft}) instead of
  the mean to avoid extra weighting of rare outliers.

While Eq. (3) can be used in PM (Eq. (1)), it will make
analytical work with the function intractable because $GPP$ is
functionally related to ET itself. Additionally, a perturbation to VPD
should induce a physiological plant response that will alter GPP and
cause an indirect change in stomatal conductance, in addition to the
direct effect of VPD in Eq. (\ref{medlyn}). Therefore, in order to
derive the response of ET to VPD, we must account for the functional
relationship between GPP, ET, and VPD, and its effect on stomatal
conductance. We can use aforementioned semi-empirical results of
\citet{Zhou_2015} as a tool to approach this
problem. \citet{Zhou_2015}, showed that  underlying Water Use
Efficiency (uWUE):

% \begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
    uWUE = \frac{GPP \cdot \sqrt{VPD}}{ET}
    \label{uwue}
  \end{equation}
% \end{linenomath*}

is relatively constant across time and moisture conditions within a
plant functional type, and correctly captures a constant relationship
between GPP, ET and VPD over a diurnal cycle \citep{Zhou_2014}. The
theoretical derivation of the square root VPD dependence in $uWUE$
leverages the same assumptions used in \cite{MEDLYN_2011} to derive the
square-root VPD dependence of the stomatal conductance model (Eq.
(\ref{medlyn})).  We can use uWUE to remove the $GPP$ dependence from
$g_s$ in a way that makes PM analytically tractable:

% \begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
    g_s = \frac{R \, T}{P} 1.6 \left(1 + \frac{g_1}{\sqrt{VPD}}\right) \frac{uWUE \; ET}{c_a \; \sqrt{VPD}}.
    \label{new_g_s}
  \end{equation}
% \end{linenomath*}

Plugging Eq. (\ref{new_g_s}) into Eq. (\ref{orig_pen}) and
rearranging gives a new explicit expression for PM, in which
dependence on $GPP$ is removed:

% \begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
    ET = \frac{\Delta R_{net} + \frac{g_a\; P}{T} \left( \frac{ c_p VPD}{R_{air}} -  \frac{\gamma c_a \sqrt{VPD} }{ R \; 1.6\; \text{ uWUE } (1 + \frac{g_1}{\sqrt{VPD}})} \right) }{ \Delta + \gamma}
    \label{et}
  \end{equation}
% \end{linenomath*}

By accounting for photosynthesis changes in ecosystem conductance, with
Eq. (\ref{et}) we have derived for the first time, using recent
results \citep[][]{MEDLYN_2011, Zhou_2014, Zhou_2015, Medlyn_2017}, ET
explicitly as function of environmental variables and two
plant-specific constants, the slope parameter ($g_1$), and uWUE, both
reflecting water conservation strategy. The slope parameter is related
to the willingness of stomata to trade water for CO$_2$ and to keep
stomata open. uWUE is a semi-empirical ecosystem-scale constant
related to how WUE changes with VPD (specifically $VPD^{-1/2}$). It is
also roughly proportional to physical constants:

\[uWUE \appropto \sqrt{\frac{c_a - \Gamma}{1.6 \lambda}},\]

where $\Gamma$ is the CO$_2$ compensation point \citep[Eq. (5)
in][]{Zhou_2014}. So uWUE is related to atmospheric CO$_2$
concentration and compensation point, and is inversely proportional to
the marginal water cost of leaf carbon.


With Equation \ref{eq} we can take the partial derivative with respect
to VPD:

% \begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial \;  ET}{\partial \; VPD} = \frac{2\; g_a \;
      P}{T(\Delta + \gamma)}   \left(\frac{ c_p}{R_{air}} -
      \frac{\gamma c_a }{1.6 \; R\; \; \text{ uWUE }} \left(
        \frac{2 g_1 + \sqrt{VPD}}{2 (g_1 + \sqrt{VPD})^2}\right)
    \right),
    \label{d_et}
  \end{equation}
% \end{linenomath*}

  deriving an analytical framework for ecosystem response to
  atmospheric demand perturbations with environmental conditions held
  fixed. There are a few subtleties to taking the derivative in
  Eq. (\ref{d_et}): $\Delta$ ($\frac{d e_{s}}{d T}$) and $VPD$ are
  functionally related, so while taking the derivative we evaluate
  $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD} = \frac{\partial \; ET}
  {\partial \; e_s} \frac{\partial \; e_s}{\partial \; VPD}
  \Big|_{\text{RH fixed}} + \frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; RH}
  \frac{\partial \; RH}{\partial \; VPD} \Big|_{\text{$e_s$
      fixed}}$. $RH$ and $e_s$ are assumed to be approximately
  independent, which is supported by data (not shown).

  This derivation relied either implicitly or explicitly on several
  assumptions. First, we assume that VPD at the leaf surface is the
  same as VPD at measurement height; physically this implies that
  leaves are perfectly coupled to the atmosphere. In reality, for some
  conditions and plant types the leaves can become decoupled from the
  boundary layer \citep{De_2017, Medlyn_2017}. Therefor, our
  derivation will be most applicable in times like the growing season,
  when relatively high insolation induces instability and convective
  boundary layers, and we would expect the surface to be generally
  well coupled. An additional assumption in the formulation of $uWUE$
  \citep{Zhou_2014, Zhou_2015} and \citet{Medlyn_2017}'s stomatal
  conductance model is that direct soil evaporation (E) contributions
  to ET remain small relative to transpiration (T). This should be
  more true during the growing season. The ratio of E to T may
  increase immediately after rainfall events due to high soil moisture
  and ponding, but VPD is generally low anyways during these
  times. However, some plant types allow for systematically larger
  contributions of E in ET, particularly those with sparse canopies
  and smaller relative amounts of transpiration. We therefore might
  expect that the theory will be most applicable to forest PFTs, which
  will be most strongly coupled to the boundary layer due to larger
  surface roughness, and will also generally have the highest ratios
  of transpiration to evaporation. Finally, we assume that $g_1$ and
  $uWUE$ are constant with respect to the conceptual VPD
  perturbation. Both quantities have been shown to be relatively
  constant with respect to changes in
  % TODO: make this a general discussion on partial derivatives and
  % what things are constant/how to interpret?
  VPD \cite{Franks_2017, Zhou_2014}. These parameters will however
  vary with plant species and characteristics \citep[e.g. wood density,
  ]{Lin_2015}, as well as environmental conditions including soil
  water content and temperature.
  % TODO: write exact parameter ranges we use, and introduce
  % scaling/sign term here?
  % \item

  To account for both this variability in plant parameters and the
  environment, we will systematically analyze how the ET reponse to
  VPD (Equation \ref{d_et}) varies. Equation \ref{d_et} includes a
  ``sign'' term that determines the sign of the response in addition
  to magnitude:

\begin{equation}
  \label{sign}
  \frac{c_p}{R_{air}} - \frac{\gamma c_a }{1.6 \; R\; \text{ uWUE }} \left( \frac{2 g_1 + \sqrt{VPD}}{2 (g_1 + \sqrt{VPD})^2}\right),
\end{equation}

and a ``scaling'' multiplying the ``sign'' term:

\begin{equation}
  \frac{g_a \; P}{T(\Delta + \gamma)}.
\end{equation}

In the ``sign term'' most of quantities are relatively constant,
except for VPD and the plant parameters g$_1$ and uWUE. In the scaling
term, most of the terms are relatively constant with the exception of
aerodynamic conductance ($g_a$) and temperature (especially its effect
through $\Delta$). To determine the range of probable ET reponses to
VPD we will systematically vary this parameters according to Table
\ref{param_varying}, while all other parametrs are held fixed (Table
\ref{param_fixed}). Physical variables ($g_a$, $T$) and plant
physiological paramters (g$_1$, uWUE) are varied according to
literature-based expectations for a range of growing season conditions
and plant types \citep{Zhou_2015, Medlyn_2017}. Using this previous
literature we can connect the effect of varying plant parameters to
specific plant types and characteristics.

\section{Results}
\label{results}

By varying four parameters (g$_a$, T, uWUE, g$_1$) at three different
values (Table \ref{param_varying}) we generate nine different values
for the scaling term, nine different curves (as a function of VPD) for
the sign term, and 81 different curves for the ET response to VPD
($\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$). Examining a subset of nine
of the curves for the ET response to VPD, defined by the minimum, median
and maximum of for each of the scaling and sign term, it is clear
that the range of responses includes those where ET almost always
decreases with increasing VPD (water conservative), ET almost always
increases with increasing VPD (water intensive), and intermediate
values where ET will increase or decrease with VPD depending on the
atmospheric demand for water (Figure \ref{full}).

\begin{figure}
  \centering \includegraphics{./fully_idealized.pdf}
  \caption{The functional form of the $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial
      \; VPD}$ for minimum, median and maximum values of both the sign
    term and the scaling term.}
  \label{full}
\end{figure}

Examining the sign term independent of the scaling term indicates the
dependence of water conservative versus water intensive response on
the main plant parameters, g$_1$ and uWUE (Figure \ref{sign}). Higher
g$_1$ and uWUE shift the curve towards increasing ET responses with
VPD (water intensive), and with increasing g$_1$ also leading to a
higher non-linear VPD dependence of the response.

\begin{figure}
  \centering \includegraphics{./fully_idealized)sign.pdf}
  \caption{The functional form of the $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial
      \; VPD}$ evaluated at the median value of the scaling term, for
    varying values of g$_1$ and uWUE as given in Table \ref{param_varying}.}
  \label{sign}
\end{figure}

Examining the scaling term independent of the sign term shows how
aerodynamic conductance (communication between the atmosphere and the
surface) and temperature (through $\Delta$ controls the efficiency of
energy conversion to latent heat), amplify or supress the plant
physiological response represented in the sign term. Both lower
temperatures and higher aerodynamic conductance lead to amplified ET
response to VPD, with the variabilty of aerodynamic conudcance
resulting in a slightly higher variability of ET response relative to
temperature, which is still an important factor.

\section{Discussion}
\label{discussion}

Interpreting both the derivation and results of this manuscript hinges
on an understanding and appreciation for the usefulness of partial
dervatives for understanding the behavior of complex systems. Our
results are a conceptual tool for answering the question, ``What is
the ET response to VPD with all other quantities held fixed?'' This is
useful, and we would argue is critical, for understanding complex
responses when many quantities are varying symotaneously. Through
partial derivatives, we can approach answering questions like ``What
is the relative contribution of VPD in some observed response given
that X Y and Z were also varying?'' In this example, X Y and Z could
be, for example, radiation, soil moisture, and temperature. Equation
\ref{d_et} explicitly provides an estimate of the ET response to VPD,
given assumptions about ecosystem plant characteristics through the
parameters g$_1$ and uWUE. Equation \ref{d_et} is generic to external
environmental factors and the timescale over which a VPD response
acts, and has a straightforward conceptual meaning. It provides the ET
response, given other quantities and parameters held fixed. So, while
the plant parameters g$_1$ and uWUE may vary with plant species and
environmental conditions like soil moisture, we can still assess the
ET response to VPD for a given plant species, or for a given soil
moisture condition.

However, given that g$_1$ and uWUE can vary, and that they both have a
large impact on the ET response (Figure \ref{full}, \ref{sign}) it is
useful to rexamine how these quantities vary in previous literature,
framed by our results on ET responses. In \citet{Zhou_2015} most plant
types have uWUE similiar to our median value, where whether ET
response is postive (water intensive) or negative (water conservative)
depends on VPD. However, crops, which we expect to prioritize carbon
uptake over water conservation, have a higher uWUE closer to our
maximum value. This higher uWUE results in a higher liklhood for an
increasing ET response to VPD, which intuitively amkes sense given
taht we expect crops ro keep stoamta open for access to carbon, at the
cost of water loss. Shrubs, and to a lesser extent grass, gave an uWUE
closer to the minumum uWUE. For these plant types, we would then
expect a higher liklhood of a water conservatve response; that is, a
decrease of ET in response to VPD. It is important to note that, while
\citet{Zhou_2015} did not examine the roll of soil moisture in within
plant-type variability of uWUE, we might expect some variation,
especially in extreme cases when soil water becomes a limiting factor.

In \citet{Medlyn_2017} there is not as robust of a relationship
between plant type and g$_1$ as there was for uWUE in
\citet{Zhou_2015}. Given that there is a robust relatiohsip between
g$_1$ and plant type in \citet{Lin_2015}, the ambiguos results in
\citet{Medlyn_2017} could be due to noise in ecosystem scale
observations, the consequences of imposing a model structure in some
of the g$_1$ observations, or real ecosystem-scale within-plant type
variability. These differences between leaf-scale behavior and
ecosystem scale behaviro highlight the importance of understanding how
and why slope parameters vary at the ecosystem scale, as argued by
\citet{Medlyn_2017}. However, if we assume that there is some real
analogy between leaf scale results in \citet{Lin_2015} and ecosystem
scale behavior, and that some of the ambiguity in \citet{Medlyn_2017}
is due to model and/or observational error, then we can make some
connections between g$_1$-induced ET response variability and plant
characteristics, which are subject to the strong caveat that we still
do not fully understand the g$_1$'s utility at the ecosystem
scale. Extrapolating \citet{Lin_2015}'s results (e.g. Fig. 2) to the
ecosystem scale would reveal the following relationships between g$_1$
and plant types:

\begin{itemize}
  \item C3 plants would have a generally higher g$_1$ than C4 plants,
  \item Crops would have a larger g$_1$ than shrubs, grass, and
    angiosperm trees, which have a higher g$_1$ than gymnosperm
    trees.
  \item Tropical and temperate climates would generally host plants
    with a higher g$_1$ than artic and boreal climates.
\end{itemize}
For all of the above relationships, a higher g$_1$ means a higher
liklihood of a postive ET response to increasing VPD (water
intensive), and a smaller VPD dependence of the ET response.

Our theoretical results, when framed by previous literature tying
parametets to plant types and climate, highlight the variability of ET
response to VPD as a function of plant characteristics. Whether an
ecosystem increases or decreases ET in response to VPD will vary
depending on vegetation and climate. Generalizations about ET response
to VPD therefore require thoughtful consideration of ecosystem
characteristics; statements such as ``ET increases with warming due to
increases in VPD'' may be false depending on the water conservation
strategy of a given ecosystem **CITE SOME EXAMPLES OF THIS LOGIC FROM
GLOBAL WARMING LIT**.

Additionally, the sensitivity of ET reponse to plant parameter
highlights the importance of understanding and developing stomatal
conductance models and parameters for the ecosystem scale. In
particular, why and how g$_1$ behavior at the leaf and ecosystem scale
are not directly analgalous much be understood. While the derivation
here was explicit about the assumptions of a constant g$_1$ term with
respect to the VPD perturbation, many sophsiticated land surface
models and earth system models employing stomatal conductance models
make similiar, and even stronger assumptions about the stationarity of
VPD slope terms. In particular, many models will assume a constant
g$_1$ term within a given plant functional type, and research derived
from these models will not acknowledge limitations of this assumption,
or difficulty in the literature with quantifying an ecosystem scale
slope paramter \citep{Medlyn_2017}. Given that something so
fundamental as the ET resposne to VPD varies strongly with g$_1$, we
must invenst more in understanding g$_1$'s behavir at the ecosystem
scale, and the efficacy of models using g$_1$'s for ecosystem-scale
fluxes.

So far we have discussed the role of different parameters in the ET
response. However, the form of the ET response is imposed by our
choice of stomatal conductance model. We now examine how the model
choice, and speicifcally the exponent of the VPD dependence in teh
stomatal conductance model, can impact the general form of the ET-VPD
relationship. This is relevant as many models include an
exponententiated VPD term \citep[e.g.,][]{Leuning_1990}, but the value
of the exponent can vary. It is useful to understand how generally the
choice of model imposes the functional form of the ET-VPD
relationship, given its fundamental importance for land atmosphere
interaction.
\subsection{Functional form of ET dependence on VPD and its relation
  to the VPD exponent}
\label{functional_form}

The theory described in Sect. \ref{sign_term} indicates that for a
given $uWUE$ and $g_1$, the ET dependence on VPD should be concave
upward, which is confirmed by eddy covariance data across most PFTs. In other words, there should be some local minimum in ET at a
critical VPD$_{crit}$, assuming the scaling and plant terms  (e.g. aerodynamic
conductance, $\Delta$, $g_1$ and $uWUE$) are held fixed. This result warrants further
investigation, because to our knowledge no one has derived the
theoretical ecosystem-scale relationship between ET and VPD while
controlling for other environmental conditions. In particular, from
personal communication, there is an apparent lack of consensus over
whether the shape of the ET-VPD curve should be concave upward (our
result) or concave downward in the absence of dramatic water stress. Given that understanding the ET-VPD
relationship of the one-way plant response is fundamental to
hypothesizing about any feedbacks between the land surface and the
atmosphere, we analyze why our derived ET-VPD relationship is concave
upward, particularly with respect to the exponent of VPD dependence in
$uWUE$ and the Medlyn unified stomatal conductance model.

There is a theoretical basis for the square root VPD dependence in
both the stomatal conductance model and $uWUE$ based on the assumption
that stomata behave to maximize carbon gain while minimizing water
loss, which observations also generally support \citep{Lloyd_1991,
  MEDLYN_2011, Lin_2015, Zhou_2014, Zhou_2015, Medlyn_2017}. However,
some purely empirical results that fit the exponent of the VPD
dependence to data have shown that it may vary slightly from 1/2,
suggesting that stomata, as well as ecosystem-scale quantities based
on stomata theory, may not always function optimally \citep{Zhou_2015,
  Lin_2018}. Specifically with regards to $uWUE$, one would not expect
that this ecosystem scale WUE quantity will respond to VPD exactly
analogously to stomata. Direct soil evaporation's contributions to ET
should shift the exponent of the VPD dependence, especially at
conditions of low GPP when we would expect a systematically larger
portion of direct soil evaporation contributions to ET, because we
would also expect lower amounts of transpiration at low GPP. \citet{Zhou_2015}'s
results corroborate this: they found a mean empirically fit
exponential VPD dependence of 0.55, varying slightly from the
theoretically optimal value of of 0.5 for AmeriFlux
sites. Interpreting \citet{Lin_2018}'s results, which also show
variance in the empirical exponent of the VPD dependence of the
stomatal conductance model, is more difficult as \citet{Lin_2018} do
not handle GPP/A dependence of stomatal conductance in a directly
analogous manner to the optimal theory in \citet{MEDLYN_2011} and
\citet{Medlyn_2017}. Regardless, given that these recent results on
the relationship between VPD, GPP, and ET \citep{MEDLYN_2011,
  Zhou_2014, Zhou_2015, Medlyn_2017} form the backbone of our analysis
and are what allowed us to derive an explicit ET expression for the
first time (Eq. (\ref{et})), we will analyze if and how assumptions
about the exponent of the VPD dependence impacts the shape of the
ET-VPD dependence. This analysis is also important to understand whether the choice of stomatal conductance model alters the fundamental behavior of the ET-VPD relationships, as many commonly used models  utilize a VPD exponent other than the 1/2 suggested by optimal theory \citep[e.g. ][ which uses an exponent of 1]{Leuning_1990}.

By introducing $n$ and $m$ we can free our stomatal
conductance model from assumptions about VPD dependence:
% \begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
    g_s = \frac{R \, T}{P} 1.6 \left(1 + \frac{g*}{VPD^m}\right) \frac{*WUE \; ET}{c_a \; VPD^n},
    \label{m_n}
  \end{equation}
% \end{linenomath*}
where:
\[*WUE = \frac{GPP}{ET}VPD^n,\] and $g*$ is a generic slope parameter
of units $VPD^m$. To determine how the exponent $n$ and $m$ alter the
shape of the ET-VPD dependence we find the roots of the second
derivative of ET, using Eq. (\ref{m_n}) for stomatal conductance
($g_s$), with respect to VPD: \input{d2_solutions.tex} With this
result we have defined the family of curves separating concave up from
concave down ET solutions (Fig. \ref{concave}). These curves are
only functions of the exponent of the VPD dependence and a quantity we
call non-dimensional VPD ($VPD^m/g*$). Several important
relations reveal themselves from Eq. (\ref{curves}):

  \caption{ Solutions corresponding to inflection points between
    concave up and concave down ET-VPD curves (Eq. (\ref{curves}))
    for three specific scenarios. Solutions are defined in terms of a
    non-dimensional VPD ($VPD^m/g_*$), but to aide physical
    interpretation the horizontal axis is additionally provided in terms of dimensionalized VPD assuming $m=1/2$ and
    $g_*=110\; Pa^{1/2}$ (average of all PFT $g_1$). The vertical axis
    has a different interpretation depending on the solution
    curve. For the blue line ($m$ varying), it corresponds to $m$,
    for the orange line ($n$ varying) it corresponds to $n$, and for
    the green line it corresponds to the value of both $n$ and $m$
    ($n=m$). Regions of the parameter space that correspond to
    concave up and concave down results are labeled.}

\begin{itemize}
  \item For optimal behavior (n, m = 1/2) the ET-VPD curve will be
    concave up regardless of the magnitude of the plant constants
    $g_1$ and $uWUE$. Therefore, the general concave up nature of our
    results, given an assumption of optimal behavior, is insensitive
    to plant type.
  \item For all physically possible exponents of VPD dependence ($n,
    m$), whether the solution is concave up or concave down does not
    depend on $uWUE$.
  \item In general, increasing the exponent of VPD dependence
    increases the likelihood of a concave down result. Additionally, as
    the exponent of VPD dependence increases from the optimum value of
    1/2, whether the curve is concave upward or concave downward
    becomes a function of the plant specific slope parameter $g_*$,
    through non-dimensional VPD ($VPD^m/g_*$). Because the exponent of
    the VPD dependencies is capable of altering the fundamental shape
    of ET-VPD dependence, future research investment in understanding
    the exact VPD dependence of stomatal conductance, and further
    reconciliation of empirical and theoretical stomatal and
    ecosystem behavior should be prioritized.
\end{itemize}

While it is possible that in the future some other form of
VPD dependence is derived, at present \cite{MEDLYN_2011} and
\cite{Zhou_2014} firmly established n=m=1/2 as the most likely
candidate given current theory and empirical data. Additionally, we
argue that a concave up result matches physical intuition more than a
concave down result. Plants must maintain nutrient and sugar transport
through the phloem and xylem. To accomplish this, stomata must remain
slightly open \citep{De_2013, Nikinmaa_2013, Ryan_2014}. Furthermore,
even if complete stomatal closure were possible, cuticular water loss
and [at the ecosystem-scale] direct soil evaporation are still sources
of ET which increase with VPD, independent of stomatal
closure. Therefore, in the limit as VPD becomes large and we assume
plants are exercising all strategies to reduce ET, any further increase
in VPD should result in an increase in ET through cuticular water loss
and/or direct soil evaporation. This inevitable transition from
conditions when stomata respond strongly to VPD to conditions when
stomata response is asymptoting towards full closure would cause a
concave up ET-VPD curve, which is matched by the theory. In short,
plant response becomes more limited as VPD increases, while
atmospheric demand monotonically increases with VPD, leading to the
 result that atmospheric demand dominates plant response when
atmospheric demand is high.

This analysis allows us to understand the theoretical shape of the ET
response to VPD with environmental conditions held
fixed. Accomplishing this with purely statistical methods applied to
flux observations would be very difficult, given the relatively fast
time scale of plant response and the non-stationarity of [solar
forced] environmental conditions over the relatively coarse (half
hourly) flux estimates (which is required to obtain robust
eddy-covariance statistics). Our results on the shape of the ET-VPD
curve with environmental conditions held fixed can be built upon with
future work examining how changes in VPD and environmental conditions
(e.g. soil water storage) feedback upon one another. In the soil water
storage example, over very long time scales extremely high VPD
perturbations coupled with no precipitation could result in decreases
in soil water storage such that water becomes limiting. This could be
represented by an extension of our framework in which uWUE is allowed
to decrease with decreasing SWC. Here, we focus our results by
framing theme with previous literature to  build baseline intuition for
ET-VPD dependence.
