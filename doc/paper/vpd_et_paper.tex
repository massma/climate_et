\section{Introduction}\explain{This section needs to be fleshed out, and I definately need to add more citations}

Changes to vapor pressure deficit (VPD) alter the atmospheric demand for water from the land surface. However, plant stomata have evolved to optimally regulate the exchange of water and carbon between vegetation and the atmosphere \citep{Franks_2017}. Therfore, an increase (decrease) in VPD may not correspond to an increase (decrease) in evapotranspiration (ET) because stomatal closure (opening) can cancel the effects of shifts to atmospheric demand.

Quantifying the plant response to a perturbation to atmospheric VPD increases our understanidng of feedbacks between the land surface and the atmosphere. If plant reponse reduces ET in response to an increase in VPD, the land surface will contribute a positive feedback in reponse to atmospheric drying. Conversely, if plant response increases ET in response to increase in VPD, then the land surface will contribute a negative feedback to atmospheric drying. The sign of these feedbacks drives the evolution of the atmosphere and landsurface at many timescales, from diurnal to interdecadal. 

Here we use a Penman-Monteith framework to quantify plant reponse to perturbations to atmospheric demand for water. Section 2 derives the framework, Section 3 describes the data used, Section 4 presents results, and Section 5 discusses conclusions.

\section{Methods}

The Penman-Monteith equation (hereafter PM) estimates ET as a function of atmospheric and land-surface variaibles:

\begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
      ET = \frac{\Delta R + g_a \rho_a c_p D_{s}}{\Delta + \gamma(1 + \frac{g_a}{g_s})},
  \end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

 where variable definitions are given in Table 1. \cite{MEDLYN_2011} developed a model for $g_s$ by combining optimal photosynthesis theory with empiracle approaches. The result for leaf-scale stomatal resistance was:

\begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
  g_{l-s} = g_0 + 1.6 \left(1 + \frac{g_1}{\sqrt{D_{s}}}\right) \frac{A}{c_s}
  \end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

This can be adapted to an ecosystem-scale stomatal resistance by multiplying by leaf area index (LAI) and converting units to m s$^{-1}$:
\begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
  g_s = \text{LAI } \frac{R* T}{P} \left( g_0 + 1.6 \left(1 + \frac{g_1}{\sqrt{D_{s}}}\right) \frac{A}{c_s}\right)
  \end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

While Equation 3 can be used in PM, it will make analytical work with the function intractable because $A$ is a relatively strong function of ET. To remove dependence of ET on $A$ we can use the semi-impiracle results of \cite{Zhou_2015}. \cite{Zhou_2015} showed that:

\begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
uWUE = \frac{GPP \cdot \sqrt{D}}{ET}
  \end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
is relatively constant across time and space (within plant functional type). If, following \cite{Lin_2015}, we approximate $g_0$ as $0$, we can use uWUE to remove $A$ from $g_s$ in a way that makes PM analytically tractable:

\begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
  g_s = \text{LAI } \frac{R* T}{P} 1.6 \left(1 + \frac{g_1}{\sqrt{D_{s}}}\right) \frac{uWUE \; ET}{c_s \; \sqrt{D}}
  \end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

Plugging Equation 5 into Equation 1 and rearranging gives:

\begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
  ET = \frac{\Delta R + \frac{g_a\; P}{T} \left( \frac{ c_p D_{s}}{R_{air}} - \frac{\gamma c_s \sqrt{D} }{\text{LAI } R* \; 1.6 \text{ uWUE } (1 + \frac{g_1}{\sqrt{D}})} \right) }{ \Delta + \gamma}
  \end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

We can then take the derivative with respect to $D$ to determine ecosystem reponse to atmospheric demand perturbations:

\begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial \;  ET}{\partial \; D} = \frac{g_a \; P}{T(\Delta + \gamma)}   \left(\frac{ c_p}{R_{air}} - \frac{\gamma c_s }{\text{LAI }1.6 \; R\; \text{ uWUE }} \left( \frac{2 g_1 + \sqrt{D}}{2 (g_1 + \sqrt{D})^2}\right) \right)
    \label{d_et}
  \end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
Note that given yearly uWUE from \cite{Zhou_2015}, $g_1$ from \cite{Lin_2015} \citep[as presented in ][]{Franks_2017}, and observations of R, T, P, D$_s$, and wind speed (WS), the only unknown is LAI. With flux tower observations of ET, LAI will then be uniquely determined for each observation through Equation 6:

\begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
    LAI  = - \frac{g_a \gamma c_s \sqrt{D_s} P }{ \left(\text{ ET } ( \Delta + \gamma) - \Delta R - g_a \rho_a c_p D_{s}\right) 1.6 \; R\; T\; \text{ uWUE } (1 + \frac{g_1}{\sqrt{D_s}})}
    \label{lai}
  \end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

This ``pseudo-LAI'' is some part ``true'' LAI (a measure of leaf area), and some part model and observational error, including error involving our assumption of constant uWUE. By calculating a unique LAI for each observation we will progate any model and observational uncertainty forward into our expression for $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial D}$.

\section{Data}

We use data from FLUXNET2015. Because $g_1$ coefficients \citep{Lin_2015} and uWUE were only both available for five plant functional types (PFTs - see Table 2),  only 56 of the 77 sites were used. Figure \ref{map_fig} presents each site and its plant functional type.


\begin{table}

\caption{Plant functional type and location of sites used in analysis. Note should probably just split this into 4 continents (US, Europe, Africa, Australia).}
\label{map_fig}
 \end{figure}

We restrict our analysis to the daytime (sensible heat > 5 W m$^{-1}$ and shortwave radiation > 50 W m$^{-2}$) when there is no precipitation and the plants are growing (GPP > 10\% of the 95th pecentile). Also, because some sites use half hourly data but some use hourly, we aggregate all data to hourly averages. Only times with good quality control flags are used.

\section{Results}

By construction, the variability in the LAI term (Equation \ref{lai}) contains all model and observational uncertities. LAI also has physical meaning corresponding to ``true'' leaf area, and we expect that it would be approximately $O(1)$. We can have some confidence in our framework, including the assumption of constant uWUE, if calculated LAIs are generally $O(1)$. Figure \ref{lai_fig} presents the histogram of calculated LAIs with outliers (lowest and highest 5\% percent) and unphysical values (LAI $<$ 0.) removed. All remaining LAI values are $O(1)$ which provides confidence in model framework.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=20pc]{./fig02.png}
\caption{Histogram of LAI values calculated for each site and time according to Equation \ref{lai}. The lowest and highest 5\% are removed as outliers, as well as any values below 0. The curve is normalized such that its area is 1.}
\label{lai_fig}
\end{figure}

An additional concern is that the LAI term may in fact be some function of $D$, in which case the dependence would need to be accounted for when taking the derivative. Figure \ref{lai_vpd_fig} plots the joint distrivution of LAI and VPD, and shows that LAI is very weakly a function of VPD. Given this weak dependence, we argue that Equation \ref{d_et} is a valid approxiamtion for ET response to $D$.

\centering
\includegraphics[width=20pc]{./fig03.png}
\caption{The joint distribution of $D$ and LAI. LAI has only a weak dependence on $D$}
\label{lai_vpd_fig}
\end{figure}


Before diving into calculated values of $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; D}$, it is useful to consider the functional form of Equation \ref{d_et}. There are three terms: a scaling term for the full expression we will call Term 1 ($\frac{g_a \; P}{T(\Delta + \gamma)}$), a relatively constant offset we will call Term 2 ($\frac{c_p}{R_{air}}$), and a variable term we will call Term 3 ($\frac{\gamma c_s }{\text{LAI }1.6 \; R\; \text{ uWUE }} \left( \frac{2 g_1 + \sqrt{D}}{2 (g_1 + \sqrt{D})^2}\right)$). All variables are constant, so the relative magnitude between Term 2 and Term 3 will determine the sign of the derivative, while Term 1 will scale the expression larger or smaller.

In Term 1, $\frac{P}{T} \propto \rho$, so this should vary little relative to $g_a$ and $\Delta$.  $\gamma$ should also be relatively constant, So the scaling term, Term 1, should be primarily a function of $g_a$ and temperature (through the function $\Delta$). While temperature range may vary for PFT, the fucntional form of $\Delta$ will be the same. $g_a$ will vary strongly with PFT due to the importance of surface roughness. However, the coeffiecent of variability for $g_a$ is relatively constant across PFT. So, the influence of $g_a$ on the relative (to the mean) variability of Term 1 is approximately similiar across PFT.

Figure \ref{scale_vary}A shows Term 1 normalized by mean $g_a$ (calcualted for each plant functional type), and confirms that much of the relative variability of Term 1 is contained in the $g_a$ term's relative variability. Additionally, the impact of $T$ on the relative variability increases with increasing $g_a$.

While the relative variability of Term 1 is similiar across PFT, the absolute value of Term 1 varies strongly across PFT. Figure \ref{scale_vary}B shows Term 1 evaluated with the mean $g_a$ for each PFT, and at the range of observed temperatures for each PFT. As expected, for the tree PFTs the Term 1 is much larger and the temperature dependence is much stronger. Additionally, because std$(g_a) \propto \overline{g_a}$, the spread of Term 1 due to $g_a$ variability will be larger, although this is not shown for simplicity. To summarize, the variability of Term 1 will look like Figure \ref{scale_vary}A for each PFT, but the scale of the x and y-axis will increase or decrease according to Figure \ref{scale_vary}B.

Additionally, stars denote the location of the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles.}

% Single-line equations are centered.
% Equation arrays will appear left-aligned.

Math coded inside display math mode \[ ...\]
 will not be numbered, e.g.,:
 \[ x^2=y^2 + z^2\]

 Math coded inside \begin{equation} and \end{equation} will
 be automatically numbered, e.g.,:
 \begin{equation}
 x^2=y^2 + z^2
 \end{equation}


% To create multiline equations, use the
% \begin{eqnarray} and \end{eqnarray} environment
% as demonstrated below.
\begin{eqnarray}
  x_{1} & = & (x - x_{0}) \cos \Theta \nonumber \\
        && + (y - y_{0}) \sin \Theta  \nonumber \\
  y_{1} & = & -(x - x_{0}) \sin \Theta \nonumber \\
        && + (y - y_{0}) \cos \Theta.
\end{eqnarray}

%If you don't want an equation number, use the star form:
%\begin{eqnarray*}...\end{eqnarray*}

% Break each line at a sign of operation
% (+, -, etc.) if possible, with the sign of operation
% on the new line.

% Indent second and subsequent lines to align with
% the first character following the equal sign on the
% first line.

% Use an \hspace{} command to insert horizontal space
% into your equation if necessary. Place an appropriate
% unit of measure between the curly braces, e.g.
% \hspace{1in}; you may have to experiment to achieve
% the correct amount of space.

%  EQUATION NUMBERING: COUNTER
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% You may change equation numbering by resetting
% the equation counter or by explicitly numbering
% an equation.

% To explicitly number an equation, type \eqnum{}
% (with the desired number between the brackets)
% after the \begin{equation} or \begin{eqnarray}
% command.  The \eqnum{} command will affect only
% the equation it appears with; LaTeX will number
% any equations appearing later in the manuscript
% according to the equation counter.
%

% If you have a multiline equation that needs only
% one equation number, use a \nonumber command in
% front of the double backslashes (\\) as shown in
% the multiline equation above.

% If you are using line numbers, remember to surround
% equations with \begin{linenomath*}...\end{linenomath*}

%  To add line numbers to lines in equations:
%  \begin{linenomath*}
%  \begin{equation}
%  \end{equation}
%  \end{linenomath*}
