\section{Introduction}

Vapor pressure deficit (VPD) is expected to rise over continents in the future due to the combination of increased temperature and relative humidity drying ** RH drying \citep{Byrne_2013 }. Increases in VPD increases the atmospheric demand of evapotranspiration (ET) \citep{Monteith_1965} but also stresses plant stomata \citep{Leuning_1990, MEDLYN_2011}.

This conflicting response between increased demand and higher stomatal stress leads to two potential but opposing perspectives on how ET adjusts to changes in VPD. The first, a hydrometeorological perspective, is that higher VPD increases atmospheric demand for water from the land surface, and this drives an increase in evapotranspiration (ET). This perspective is particularly relevant because potential evapotranspiration (PET), which is used in many drought indices and hydrometeorological studies \citep[e.g.,][]{Heim_2002, Scheff_2015}, typically only quantifies changes in atmospheric demand with limited surface regulation though ecosystem resistance regualtion \citep{Swann_2016}. On the other hand, there is another perspective for vegetated surfaces. Plants' stomata have evolved to optimally regulate the exchange of water and carbon, and tend to partially close in response to increased atmospheric dryness \citep{Ball_1987, Leuning_1990, MEDLYN_2011}. Therefore, an increase in VPD, particularly in well-watered soil conditions, may actually correspond to a decrease in ET because of stomatal closure. This decrease in ET would reduce and potentially cancel, in the case of full stomatal closure, the effects of shifts to atmospheric demand. In other words, the  question ``When does VPD drive or reduce ET?'' can be related to whether plant regulation or atmospheric demand dominates ET.

The ET response to changes in VPD alters water partitioning between the soil and atmosphere. If plant response reduces ET in response to atmospheric drying then soil moisture will be better conserved. This would seem a sensible evolutionary strategy to cope with aridity. If stomata were fully passive \citep [similar to soil pores, e.g. ][]{Or_2013}, increased atmospheric aridity would strongly reduce soil moisture \citep{Berg_2017}. In turn, this would further increase aridity as low soil moisture levels increase the Bowen ratio, and in turn increase temperature and atmospheric drying \citep[][]{Bouchet_1963, Morton_1965, Brutsaert_1999, Ozdogan_2006, Salvucci_2013, Gentine_2016, Berg_2016}. This however would not seem to be a sensible strategy for plants from an evolutionary standpoint.

We can use intuition about plant water conservation strategy to hypothesize about ET response to changes in VPD. Plants that evolved to conserve water, such as arid shrubs, should be more likely to reduce ET with increasing VPD, and plants that have evolved or have been engineered to care little about water, such as crops, will be more likely to increase ET with increasing VPD. Atmospheric conditions must matter as well. At the ecosystem scale, there are limits to plant water conservation strategies. As atmospheric demand for water (VPD) increases further, ecosystems should begin to reach their water conservation limits and might not be able to entirely limit the ET flux to the atmosphere. At this stage any further increase in VPD will most likely drive a (limited) increase in ET, because the increase in atmospheric demand for water overwhelms the limited plant response to conserve water.

The objective of the present manuscript is thus to evaluate the VPD dependence of ET, in non-extreme soil drought conditions. The goal of this paper is to use reasonable approximations as a tool to drive intuition for plant response to atmospheric drying. This intuition will aid interpretation of observations and full complexity models. In order to quantify plant response to perturbations in VPD, we apply a Penman-Monteith framework to derive theoretical response of ET to VPD. The model is then validated and tested at multiple eddy-covariance stations spanning various climates and plant functional types. Section 2 describes the data used. Section 3 derives the framework. Section 4 presents results and comparison to observations. Section 5 discusses conclusions. 

\section{Data}
\label{data}
We use both meteorological and eddy-covariance data from the FLUXNET2015 database, including all sites with more than four years of data (data available at https://fluxnet.fluxdata.org/data/fluxnet2015-dataset/). Each site's plant functional type (PFT) was classified using the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme vegetation classification scheme \citep{Loveland_1999}. The physical constants used for water use efficiency in Section \ref{methods} are only published for five plant functional types (PFTs): crops (CRO), deciduous broadleaf forest (DBF), evergreen needleleaf forest (ENF), grass (GRA), and closed shrub (CSH) (see Table \ref{pft}). There are 56 sites with these plant functional types, and their location is shown in  Figure \ref{map_fig} \explain{map needs to be improved - it's a placeholder for now}.

The purpose of this study is to examine ecosystem response to atmospheric drying focusing on the growing season. To accomplish this, we filter and quality control the data using a similar procedure as \cite{Zhou_2015}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Only measured or highest (``good'') quality gapfilled data, according to quality control flags, are used.
\item To isolate the growing season, we only use days in which the average Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) exceeds 10\% of the observed 95th percentile of GPP for a given site. GPP is calculated using the nighttime respiration partitioning method.
\item We remove days with rain and the day following to avoid issues with rain interception and sensor saturation at high relative humidity (\cite{MEDLYN_2011}).
\end{itemize}
Additionally, we restrict data to the daytime, which is identified when downwelling shortwave radiation is greater than 50 W m$^{-2}$ and sensible heat flux is greater than 5 W m$^{-2}$. To further reduce the chance of sensor saturation at high relative humidity, we remove all time steps for which VPD is less than .01 kPa. Timesteps with negative observed GPP or ET are also removed, and we aggregate half hourly data to hourly averages to reduce noise. After these quality control procedures, 332556 upscaled hourly observations remain. 

\section{Methods}
\label{methods}
The Penman-Monteith equation \citep [hereafter PM,][]{Monteith_1965} estimates ET as a function of observable atmospheric variables and surface conductances:
\begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
      ET = \frac{\Delta R + g_a \rho_a c_p VPD}{\Delta + \gamma(1 + \frac{g_a}{g_s})},
  \end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
where $\Delta$ is the change in saturation vapor pressure with temperature, given by Clausius-Clapeyron ($\frac{d \; e_s}{d \; T}$), $R$ is the net radiation minus ground heat flux, $g_a$ is aerodynamic conductance, $\rho_a$ is air density, $c_p$ is specific heat of air at constant pressure, $\gamma$ is the psychometric constant, and $g_s$ is the stomatal conductance (Table 1). \citet{MEDLYN_2011} developed a model for stomatal conductance ($g_s$) by combining an optimal photosynthesis theory \citep{Farquhar_1980, Katul_2010} with an empirical approach, which describes the dependence of $g_s$ to VPD. This resulted in the following model for leaf-scale stomatal conductance was:

\begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
  g_{l-s} = g_0 + 1.6 \left(1 + \frac{g_1}{\sqrt{VPD}}\right) \frac{A}{c_s}
  \end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
Where $g_1$ is a leaf-scale ``slope'' parameter, A is the net CO$_2$ assimilation rate, and $c_s$ is the atmospheric CO$_2$ concentration at the leaf surface. \cite{MEDLYN_2011} relate the slope parameter ($g_1$) to physical parameters as:
\begin{linenomath*}
  \label{slope}
  \begin{equation}
  g_1 = \sqrt{\frac{3 \, \Gamma \, \lambda}{1.6}},\footnote{Note the above expression has units of of (mmol mol$^{-1}$)$^{1/2}$, but this can be converted to Pa$^{1/2}$ using the ideal gas law.}
  \end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

where $\Gamma$ is the CO$_2$ compensation point for photosynthesis (without dark respiration), and $\lambda$ is the marginal cost of leaf carbon. So, $g_1$ is a leaf-scale term reflecting the tradeoff of water for carbon uptake and growth. The higher $g_1$, the more open are the stomata and the more they release water in exchange for carbon.

The Medlyn model for stomatal conductance has been shown to behave very well across PFTs, compared to other models from the leaf to ecosystem scale \citep[ZHOU ET AL AS WELL** ?? - Pierre says Zhou 2014][]{Lin_2015, Zhou_2015}. It is adapted at the ecosystem scale by multiplying $g_{l-s}$ by leaf area index (LAI) and converting units to m s$^{-1}$:

\begin{linenomath*}
  \label{medlyn}
  \begin{equation}
  g_s = \text{LAI} \frac{R \,T}{P} \left( g_0 + 1.6 \left(1 + \frac{g_1}{\sqrt{VPD}}\right) \frac{A}{c_s}\right)
  \end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

While Equation 3 can be used in PM (Equation 1), it will make analytical work with the function intractable because $A$, net CO$_2$ assimilation, is functionally related to ET itself. To remove the dependence of ET on $A$ we use a fundamental semi-empirical results of \citet{Zhou_2015}, who showed that the underlying Water Use Efficiency $uWUE$:

\begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
    \label{uwue}
uWUE = \frac{GPP \cdot \sqrt{VPD}}{ET}
  \end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
is relatively constant across time and moisture conditions within a plant functional type (CITE ALSO CHAGJIE ** ??), in non-extreme drought conditions. If, following \citet{Lin_2015}, we approximate $g_0$ as $0$ (i.e. we neglect cuticular and epidermal losses - a reasonable assumption except in very dry conditions), we can use uWUE to remove the $A$ dependence from $g_s$ in a way that makes the PM equation analytically tractable:

\begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
  g_s = \frac{R \, T}{P} 1.6 \left(1 + \frac{g_1}{\sqrt{VPD}}\right) \frac{uWUE \; ET}{c_s \; \sqrt{VPD}}
  \end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

Note that $uWUE$ is fit on the ecosystem scale as in \citet{Zhou_2015} so GPP in \ref{uwue} is really $A\cdot \text{LAI}$. This leads to the cancellation of LAI in addition to uWUE in Equation \ref{medlyn}. Plugging Equation 5 into Equation 1 and rearranging gives a new expression for PM ET directly as a function of VPD with no $A$ dependence:

\begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
    ET = \frac{\Delta R + \frac{g_a\; P}{T} \left( \frac{ c_p VPD}{R_{air}} -  \frac{\gamma c_s \sqrt{VPD} }{ R* \; 1.6\; \text{ uWUE } (1 + \frac{g_1}{\sqrt{VPD}})} \right) }{ \Delta + \gamma}
    \label{et}
  \end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

With Equation \ref{et}, ET is explicitly a function of environmental variables and two plant-specific constants, the slope parameter ($g_1$), and $uWUE$, both reflecting water conservation strategy. The slope parameter is a leaf-scale term related to the willingness of stomata to trade water for CO$_2$ and to keep stomata open. $uWUE$ is semi-empirical ecosystem-scale constant related to how WUE changes with VPD (specifically $VPD^{-1/2}$). In the eddy-covariance FLUXNET2015 data described in Section \ref{data}, every term in Equation \ref{et} is observed, except for the two parameters $g_1$, and $uWUE$, which have however been measured for the PFTs considered here \citep{Zhou_2015, Lin_2015}. However, eddy-covariance data are inherently noisy so that we include a measure of uncertainty in our analysis. To account for both mean deviations of $uWUE$ and uncertainty, we introduce an uncertainty parameter $\sigma$ modifying $uWUE$:

\begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
    ET = \frac{\Delta R + \frac{g_a\; P}{T} \left( \frac{ c_p VPD}{R_{air}} -  \frac{\gamma c_s \sqrt{VPD} }{ R* \; 1.6\; \sigma \; \text{ uWUE } (1 + \frac{g_1}{\sqrt{VPD}})} \right) }{ \Delta + \gamma}
    \label{et_sigma}
  \end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

Now, from each FLUXNET2015 observation (i.e. for each semi-hourly data, at every time step) we can evaluate $\sigma$:

\begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
\sigma = - \frac{g_a \gamma c_s \sqrt{VPD} L_v P }{ \left(\text{ ET } ( \Delta + \gamma) - \Delta R - g_a \rho_a c_p VPD\right) 1.6 \; R\; T\; \text{ uWUE } (1 + \frac{g_1}{\sqrt{VPD}})},
    \label{sigma}
  \end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

Thus, with this uncertainty analysis we can evaluate departure from our theory in observations, as a departure of $\sigma$ from unity. The variability of $\sigma$ across sites and time provides a measure of uncertainty in our model, assumptions, as well as in the FLUXNET201 observations themselves. To correct for differences in sampling between \cite{Zhou_2015} and our data, we set uWUE such that $\overline{\sigma} = 1$. The variability of $\sigma$ then propagates through any uncertainty to our derivative of Equation \ref{et_sigma}:

\begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial \;  ET}{\partial \; VPD} = \frac{2\; g_a \; P}{T(\Delta + \gamma)}   \left(\frac{ c_p}{R_{air}} -  \frac{\gamma c_s }{1.6 \; R*\; \sigma \; \text{ uWUE }} \left( \frac{2 g_1 + \sqrt{VPD}}{2 (g_1 + \sqrt{VPD})^2}\right) \right)
    \label{d_et}
  \end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

With Equation \ref{d_et} we have an analytical framework for ecosystem response to atmospheric demand perturbations, in non extreme drought conditions. There are a few subtleties to taking the derivative in Equation \ref{d_et}: $\Delta$ ($\frac{d e_{s}}{d T}$) and $VPD$ are functionally related, so while taking the derivative we evaluate $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD} = \frac{\partial \; ET} {\partial \; e_s} \frac{\partial \; e_s}{\partial \; VPD} \Big|_{\text{RH fixed}} + \frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; RH} \frac{\partial \; RH}{\partial \; VPD} \Big|_{\text{$e_s$ fixed}}$. $RH$ and $e_s$ are assumed to be approximately independent, which is supported by the data (not shown). 

We note one final comment on our derivation which is relevant for drought indices. If we approximate $c_s$ at a global mean CO$_2$ concentration, then the RHS of Equation \ref{et} is fully defined using commonly available weather station data and the constants published in \citet{Zhou_2015} and \citet{Lin_2015}. This makes Equation \ref{et} a useful alternative to PET in drought indices and hydrometeorological analysis for vegetated surfaces. Equation \ref{et} better reflects the physics of water exchange at the land surface and would only require fitting of $uWUE$ and $g_1$, and can also account for changes in CO$_2$ concentration, contrary to typical drought indices such as the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) \citep{Swann_2016}.

\section{Results}
\label{results}

By construction, the variability in the $\sigma$ term (Equation \ref{sigma}) contains all model and observational uncertainties. For an observation that perfectly matches our model and constant uWUE assumption $\sigma$ will be one. Therefore, for our assumptions and framework to be reasonable $\sigma$ should be close to 1. Figure \ref{lai_fig} presents the histogram of calculated $\sigma$s with outliers removed (lowest and highest 5\% percent). All remaining $\sigma$ values are close to unity (i.e. $O(1)$), which provides further confidence in the model framework and in the data quality.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=20pc]{./fig02.png}
\caption{Histogram of $\sigma$ values calculated for each site and time according to Equation \ref{sigma}. The lowest and highest 5\% are removed as outliers, as well as any values below 0. The curve is normalized such that its area is 1. }
\label{lai_fig}
\end{figure}

An additional concern is that $\sigma$ may in fact be correlated with $VPD$, in which case the dependence would need to be accounted for when taking the derivative. However, the joint distribution of $\sigma$ and VPD shows that $\sigma$ is very weakly a function of VPD (Figure \ref{lai_vpd_fig}). Given this weak dependence, we argue that Equation \ref{d_et} is a valid approximation for ET response to $VPD$.

\begin{figure}[h]

\includegraphics[width=20pc]{./fig03.png}
\caption{The joint distribution of $VPD$ and $\sigma$. $\sigma$ has only a weak dependence on $VPD$. \textbf{***note I am redoing/cleaning up this plot, ``lai'' should read sigma***}}
\label{lai_vpd_fig}
\end{figure}

Before calculating the sensitivity of ET to VPD, we will consider the functional form of Equation \ref{d_et}. There are two main terms: a ``scaling'' term, which modifies the magnitude but not the sign of the ET response to VPD  ($\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$):

\begin{equation}
  \frac{g_a \; P}{T(\Delta + \gamma)},
\end{equation}

and a ``sign'' term, which determines whether ET increases or decreases with VPD (i.e. atmospheric demand driven or physiologically controlled):

\begin{equation}
  \label{sign}
  \frac{c_p}{R_{air}} - \frac{\gamma c_s }{1.6 \; R\; \text{ uWUE }} \left( \frac{2 g_1 + \sqrt{VPD}}{2 (g_1 + \sqrt{VPD})^2}\right).
\end{equation}
All variables are positive, so the relative magnitude between the first term and the second term in Equation \ref{sign} will determine whether ET increases or decreases with increasing VPD. If the second term is larger then the plant control dominates and ET decreases with increasing VPD. However, if the first term is larger, then atmospheric demand dominates and ET increases with increasing VPD. 

\subsection{Functional Form of the Sign Term}
\label{sign_term}
First, we explore the variables within the sign term to gain better intuition on the driver of either the increase or reduction of ET with VPD. CO$_2$ concentration ($c_s$) and the psychometric constant ($\gamma$) are relatively constant over the dataset considered here so that the variability is dominated by $\sigma$ and $VPD$. $uWUE$ could vary with soil moisture but has been shown to be relatively constant except in very dry soil conditions  (ZHOU ET AL, LIN ET AL ** ??)\explain{Pierre, which Zhou and Lin citations were you referring to that show that uWUE changes with very dry soil conditions?}. We thus further assume that the soil is not too dry so that $uWUE$ can be approximated as a constant (within PFT). This then means that the sign term only depends on VPD for a given PFT and is approximately just a function of $VPD$. We can further determine a critical threshold separating an increase from a decrease in ET, I.e. the threshold $VPD_{crit}$ such as the derivative vanishes $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD} = 0$:

\begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
VPD_{crit} = \frac{R_{air}}{4 c_p} \left( \frac{\gamma c_s}{1.6\; R \; \overline{\sigma} uWUE} + \sqrt{\frac{\gamma c_s}{1.6\; R \; \overline{\sigma} uWUE}\left( \frac{\gamma c_s}{1.6\; R \; \overline{\sigma} uWUE} + 8 g_1 \frac{c_p}{R_{air}}\right)} - 4 g_1 \frac{c_p}{R_{air}} \right)
\label{vpd_min_et}
  \end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

We note that $VPD_{crit}$ mostly depends on the PFT parameters $uWUE$ and $g_1$ but only vary weakly with climate as most other parameters related to the environment are nearly constant. The value of $VPD_{crit}$ for each PFT is shown in Table \ref{vpd_crit}. For any values of $VPD$ less than $VPD_{crit}$, ET will thus decrease with increasing VPD ($\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD} < 0$), and for values of $VPD$ greater than $VPD_{crit}$, ET will increase with increasing VPD ($\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD} > 0$). In other words, ecosystems regulate and mitigate evaporative losses up to the VPD limit, $VPD_{crit}$, above which atmospheric demand is just too high to be entirely compensated by stomatal and ecosystem regulation. We note however that even though ET increases again above the critical threshold, $VPD_{crit}$, ET is still much lower that potential evaporation as stomata are still strongly regulating vapor fluxes tot he atmosphere. Indeed, even in the absence of soil pore evaporation, stomata do not shut down entirely at very high VPD so that ET does not go to zero, because stomata are still slightly open to perform some photosynthesis \citep{Ball_1987, Leuning_1990, MEDLYN_2011}. In addition, upward xylem transport is necessary to maintain phloem transport, as well as nutrient transport and thus carbon allocation \citep{De_2013, Nikinmaa_2013, Ryan_2014}.

For values of $VPD$ less than $VPD_{crit}$, $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$ will be negative, and for values of $VPD$ greater than $VPD_{crit}$, $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$ will be positive. \textbf{**** this statistics are dated, need to update***}}

\end{table}

Differences in $VPD_{crit}$ are exclusively determined by $uWUE$ and the slope parameter ($g_1$) related to the plant functional type. A larger $uWUE$ means a smaller $VPD_{crit}$, and an ET response to increases VPD that is more likely to be positive. At first glance this result is somewhat counterintuitive; we expect that plants with a higher water use effiency would be more water conservative. However, in reality $uWUE$ determines how $WUE$ changes with VPD:

\[WUE = \frac{GPP}{ET} = \frac{uWUE}{\sqrt{VPD}}.\]
\[\frac{\partial \; WUE}{\partial \; VPD} = -\frac{uWUE}{2 \; VPD^{3/2}}\]

So, plants with a higher $uWUE$ will have a greater \textit{decrease} in ecosystem-scale $WUE$ in response to increases in VPD. This decrease in $WUE$ causes more water loss per unit carbon production, and explains the relationship between high $uWUE$ and high liklihood of increases of ET in response to increasing atmospheric drying (increases in VPD).

A tendency towards increasing ET response with increasing VPD can also be caused by a high slope parameter ($g_1$), characteristic of plants that at the leaf scale are more willing to trade water for stomata opening. Plants that are less conservative will be thus be more likely to increase ET with increasing VPD. Both the aforementioned effects (large $uWUE$, $g_1$) can amplify each other, and generally conspire to shift the sign term towards a positive value for a given PFT.

This effect of $uWUE$ and $g1$ on the sign term is most apparent by comparing two extreme PFTs: water intensive CRO and water conservative CSH. CRO has a high slope parameter ($g_1 = 183.1 \, Pa^{1/2}$) compared to CSH ($g1 = 148.6 \, Pa^{1/2}$. It also has a slightly higher uWUE ($2.32$ -units-) compared to CSH ($uWUE=2.11$ -units-). \explain{MAYBE A DUMB QUESTION BUT CAN'T uWUE AND G1 BE ANALYTICALLY RELTED> I THINK AT LESAT YOU SHOULD MAKE CLEAR THAT UWUE IS AT THE ECOYSTEM SCALE (DID YOU FIT IT OR USED PUBLISHED DATA-I AM NOW CONFUSED)}. These differences in slope parameter cause opposite ET responses to changes in VPD between CRO and CSH. ET theoretically always increases with increasing VPD for the more water intensive CRO, while ET almost always decreases with increasing VPD for the more water conservative CSH (Figure \ref{term3}). CRO evolved or were bred to prioritize GPP and yield and are thus not water conservative. They are very willing to trade water for photosynthesis and productivity, despite changes in VPD, while CSH are very unwilling to trade water for more photosynthesis.

As expected, the slope parameter ($g_1$) is a primary determinant of the VPD dependence for the sign term shown in Figure \ref{term3}. Plants that are more conservative (small $g_1$) will tend to reduce ET with increasing VPD, and will be very effective at reducing ET, especially at low VPD. However, at very high VPD, gradients in vapor pressure at the leaf scale will be so strong that they will begin to dominate leaf-scale plant strategies of stomatal (partial) closure (parameterized with $g_1$). As a result, ET response will begin to asymptote towards its ecosystem-scale values irregardless of leaf-scale strategy and stomatal regulation (parameterized with $g_1$). Therefore, plants with a low $g_1$ will have the largest VPD dependence of ET response because the difference in ET response at low VPD (leaf stomatal response dominates) and high VPD (VPD gradient dominates) is largest. This is apparent in the strong VPD dependence of ENF, which has the lowest slope parameter ($g_1=74.31$), in Figure \ref{term3}.  

To summarize our theoretical insights, Figure \ref{term3} and Table \ref{vpd_crit}, CROs are the least water conservative and have the strongest overall tendency to increase ET with increasing VPD, while CSH are the most water conservative and have the strongest tendency to decrease ET with increasing VPD.  ENF ($g_1 = 74.31$) has by far the largest VPD response dependence, while CRO ($g_1 = 183.1$) has the smallest VPD dependence. ENF are less willing to trade water for GPP, so the difference between the response at low VPD when leaf response dominates and high VPD when vapor pressure gradients dominate is much greater. CROs on the other hand have a more aggressive water use strategy and are more willing to trade water for photosynthesis, so the leaf scale response is much smaller, and the difference in ET response between low VPD and high VPD is relatively small.

Figure \ref{term3} clearly shows, according to our theory, that for all PFTs except for crops there is frequent occurrence of a negative (plant dominating) ET response to increases in VPD. Therefore, plants are able in most atmospheric conditions to reduce ET in response to increased VPD and thus to reduce water loss. To better illustrate this, the ranges of observed environmental VPDs at the FLUXNET sites are plotted parallel to the x-axis. For CSH, VPD is always less than VPD$_{crit}$ so that the plant response dominates in typical environmental conditions, emphasizing the water conservative strategy of those plants. For CRO on the other hand, VPD is almost always higher than VPD$_{crit}$, emphasizing that those plants operate with an aggressive water usage strategy, are water intensive and were actually engineered for photosynthesis rather than water saving. For forests and grass, whether plant response or atmospheric demand dominates is more dependent on environmental conditions, with about half of the observed VPD less than VPD$_{crit}$, i.e. in conditions where plant response dominates. It is also important to note that even when atmospheric demand dominates, ET response to VPD is still far smaller than it would be for potential evaporation $\partial PET/\partial VPD$, i.e. atmospheric demand only, emphasizing that there is still a strong regulation of evaporative flux by stomata and though the plant xylem. The sign term in this case would just be a constant ($\frac{c_p}{R_{air}} \approx 3.5$), which is far larger than any part of the curves for any PFT. This highlights the deficiencies of PET's ability to capture land response to changes in atmospheric dryness (VPD). Plants are always regulating water exchange from the land surface, even when they reach the limits of they ability to do so. Therefore, the actual land surface response to a change in VPD will always me more negative than if the plants are not included in the physics (PET).

\subsection{Functional Form of the Scaling Term}
\label{scale_term}
While the above discussion of the sign of $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$ is important to answer our question, understating the overall magnitude of the ET response is important to the soil-plant-atmosphere water budgeting. So we now more closely examine the terms that affect how the sign term is scaled:

\begin{equation}
  \frac{g_a \; P}{T(\Delta + \gamma)},
\end{equation}

$\frac{P}{T}$ is an air-density term, which varies little compared to aerodynamic conductance and Clausius-Clapeyron ($\Delta$). The psychometric constant ($\gamma$) is also relatively constant, so the scaling term should be primarily a function of aerodynamic conductance and temperature, through the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship $\Delta$. This is as expected, given that the aerodynamic conductance represents the efficiency of exchange between the surface and the atmosphere. As aerodynamic conductance  increases, any plant response will be communicated more strongly to the atmosphere (and vice-versa).

$\Delta$'s presence in the scaling term also matches physical intuition. Evaporative cooling will dampen the ability of the atmosphere to take more moisture (UNCLEAR SENTENCE REFORMULATE **), because $e_{s}$ decreases with decreasing temperature. The decrease in $e_{s}$ is proportional to $\Delta$ ($\delta e_{s} = \Delta \delta T$). So as $\Delta$ increases, you will get a larger damping of ET due to evaporative cooling. The functional from of $\Delta$ will be the same across PFT, but the temperature range may vary slightly. In contrast, aerodynamic conductance will vary strongly with PFT due to the importance of surface roughness for aerodynamic conductance. So most of the differences in scaling between PFT should be in the aerodynamic conductance term. 

The control of the scaling term variability between PFTs by aerodynamic conductance is confirmed by the data (Figure \ref{scale_vary}). Differences between PFT are almost entirely due to differences in aerodynamic conductance, rather than differences in observed temperature ranges. The scaling term for the tree PFTs (DBF, ENF) is generally more than double the scaling terms for the other PFTs which have lower surface roughness and generally smaller aerodynamic conductance.

Within each PFT, the scaling term variability is controlled both by environmental temperature and aerodynamic conductance variability (Figure \ref{scale_vary}). While the observed variability of the aerodynamic conductance contributes more to the scaling term variability than temperature, the temperature contribution is non-negligible. Specifically, the scaling term is generally larger at low temperatures when ET is weakly damped by Clausius-Clapeyron, and the effect of aerodynamic conductance variability is stronger as it is less weakly damped by Clausius-Clapeyron.

To summarize, variability between PFTs is mostly controlled by systematic differences in aerodynamic conductance, due to differences in surface roughness between each PFT and wind conditions. In contrast, variability within PFT is also controlled by temperature, through Clausius-Clapeyron. But, aerodynamic conductance variability generally impacts the scaling term more than temperature, even within PFT.

\subsection{Bulk statistics of ET response to VPD}
\label{stats_sec}
FORULATE THAT DIFFERNTLY< SAY WE NOW TURN TO OBSERVATIONS> YOU HVAE ALREADY DISCSSED SIGAMA AND IRTS DEFINTION. MENTION IT WHILE HYOU DISCUSS THE RESULS BUT DO NOT MAKE IT THE MAIN FOCUS. I TRIED DOING IT

In this section we consider direct observations of ET response with eddy-covariance data, while including uncertainty with the $\sigma$ term (Section \ref{methods}). These observational results of ET response largely confirm our theoretical analysis, presented in Sections \ref{sign_term}-\ref{scale_term} (Table \ref{stats}). For all PFTs, mean ET response to increasing VPD is negative. However, ET response evaluated at the average of all variables (e.g. $\sigma$, $T$, $c_s$, $VPD$) is only negative for CSH and GRA. This difference in mean ET response as compared to the ET response at mean environmental conditions is due to the non-linear nature of the response, in which negative responses are generally much larger magnitude than positive responses (Figure \ref{sign_plot}). Therefore, both the mean ET response as well as the ET response at mean environmental conditions matches our expectations from the theory (Section \ref{sign_term}), with the exception that CRO observations are shifted more towards a negative ET response than we expect.

Regarding the frequency of negative and positive ET response, 53\% of ENF observations, 65\% of GRA observations, and 93\% of CSH observations are characterized by a negative ET response to increasing VPD. The response for these PFTs is thus more frequently physiologicaly controlled, and these PFTs will tend to conserve soil water for futre use. However DBF and CRO observations have greater frequency of positive ET response to increasing VPD (46\% and 49\% of observations, respectively), and are more intensive in their use of water. 

In general the bulk statistics match our theoretical expectations well, with the caveat that inclusion of uncertainty shifts crops towards a slightly more negative response than the theory and Figure \ref{sign_plot} would suggest. The bulk statistics motivate a more thorough examination of the structure of uncertainty and more sophisticated validation of our theory's performance against observations.

\subsection{Validation of theory at eddy-covariance sites}
\label{testing}
While Section \ref{stats_sec} presented simple statistics of observed response, we now compare more sophisticated distributions of the observed response to our theory presented in Section \ref{sign_term}. Figure \ref{agu_fig} shows observed the distribution of of the sign term, as compared to what the theory would predict. Our goal was to capture the leading order behavior of the ET dependence on VPD. Given the assumptions we have made, and the uncertainties of flux tower observations themselves, we expect a relatively large amount of noise when reproducing the derivatives of ET. However, the data largely reproduces our theoretical analysis.

For DBF our theory is successful towards this goal: the theory matches the leading order behavior of the function when uncertainty is included, and the DBF response appears as expected: i.e. is similar to the theory with some additional noise. The VPD dependence, given by the slope parameter ($g_1$), follows the median values of each box plot. Perhaps most importantly, the x-intercept, and thus VPD$_{crit}$, matches nearly exactly between the theory and the observations. Therefore the sign of the ET response to increases in VPD should be well matched, subject to the unavoidable constraints of noise, much of which comes from the observations themselves. The uncertainty is non negligible; there are many observations in each box for which the the sign of observation is opposite the response predicted by the theory, but to leading order our theory matches the observations well.

While CSH has a much different functional form of the sign term than DBF, CSH observations also match our theory to leading order. Again, the VPD dependence mostly determined from the slope parameter ($g_1$) closely matches the medians in the observation bins and the theoretical threshold is well reproduced. The VPD-independent, strongly negative response, which is determined by $uWUE$, is also captured. For CSH, there is extremely rare occurrence of positive ET response with VPD, even with uncertainty, so the sign of the observations almost always matches the sign of the theory.

As Section \ref{stats_sec} suggested, the theory does not match as well for CRO as for DBF and CSH. At low VPD the VPD dependence (due to $g_1$) is similar to the leading order behavior of the observations, but the theory's curve is shifted towards more positive values relative to the observations, due to some bias in $uWUE$. Most strikingly, the observations show a tendency to move back towards negative values at high VPD, which given the functional form of VPD dependence, is behavior that is impossible for the theory to capture. This general positive bias of the theory explains the shift towards negative ET response observed in the bulk statistics of Section \ref{stats_sec}. The divergence between the theory and the observations for CRO could have been expected. For practical reasons, our theory does not include important sources of plant type heterogeneity within and across sites for CRO. In agricultural landscape, the footprint of an eddy-covariance tend to not only observe a single species but many differnent ones, with potentially varying water use strategies. We also do not account for seasonal changes in LAI, variability in crop height and surface roughness, differences in C3 vs C4 photosynthesis and water strategies, or differences in irrigation practices between the sites and years. These deficiencies should largely explain the inability of our theory to exactly match the observations in croplands. For example, a superposition of sites with C3 plants (at low environmental VPD) and C4 plants (at high environmental VPD) would explain observed shift back towards negative ET response at high VPD when all sites are binned together, as in Figure \ref{agu_fig}.  

The theory for GRA suffers from similar limitations as for CRO. GRA observations are characterized by a consistent trend back towards negative ET response at higher VPD, which the functional form of our theory is incapable of accounting for. As compared to CRO, the divergence between the theory and the observations is even greater for GRA, but these differences are explainable by similar issues as for CRO. The GRA PFT tends to exhibit substantial within FPT difference, such as C3 vs C4 photosynthesis, as well as strong seasonal variability in height and LAI. As with CRO, the trend back towards negative ET response at higher VPD could be explained by a superposition of sites with C3 vs C4 sites. Unfortunately, because detailed site-level data of C3 vs C4 plant type is not available, we could not bin CRO and GRA further by irrigation and photosynthesis strategy. However, we hypothesize that the theory would validate against observations much better when photosynthesis pathways are accounted for. 

The comparison between the theory and observations for ENF is unique from the rest of the PFTs. The VPD dependence of the theory, determined by the slope parameter ($g_1$), is not well captured by observations. However, the theory closely captures the x-intercept and VPD$_{crit}$. So, the theory still captures when the ET response will be positive or negative, but is less accurate with the magnitude of the response. Therefore the theory is still useful for addressing when VPD drives or reduces ET. We note however that we used published constants for $g_1$ \citep[from ][]{Lin_2015}, which determines the VPD dependence and that deviations should be expected across sites. We could have fit our own constants so that the theory would best match the observations, but our goal was to use a priori results whenever possible in order to avoid overfitting and to have a theoretical approach as independent to the observations as possible for further confirmation of the validity of the approach.

While the above discussion shows that our theory has some limitations when applied to some PFTs, especially for crops and grasslands, it does well for DBF and CSH PFTs, and captures the sign of the response consistently for ENF. It is useful to also compare our theory, the observed uncertainty in the ET response, and PET, as PET is often used as a proxy for ET in hydrometeorological studies and drought indices. Again, as in Section \ref{sign_term}, the PET sensitivity to VPD will be constant at about 3.5. In Figure \ref{agu_fig} the ET response to shifts in dryness is always far smaller than 3.5 in the observations, even with all uncertainty included. So the PET response to atmospheric dryness is outside the range of all observable responses. This casts doubt on PET's usefulness for capturing the leading order behavior of water budget and dryness response at the land surface, such as used in several drought indices. However our theory (Equation \ref{et}) could be used with published $uWUE$ and $g1$ data, as an alternative to PET to estimating land response and dryness, and would more accurately account for the response to atmospheric drying.

\subsubsection{Testing VPD$_{crit}$}
As stated in the above discussion of ENF, we are mostly interested in the critical threshold $VPD_{crit}$ for which the sign of the ET response to VPD ($\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$) is determined. When VPD is less than VPD$_{crit}$, ET response to VPD is negative ($\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}  < 0$), i.e. plant response dominates, and when VPD is greater than VPD$_{crit}$, ET response to VPD is positive  ($\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD} > 0$). i.e. atmospheric demand dominates. Theoretically, this $VPD_{crit}$ is mostly a function of PFT and not of climate. This $VPD_{crit}$, and how it compares with environmental VPD and water supply, will exert a strong control on species selection in competitive environments. 

Figure \ref{real} presents calculated $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$ where, unless otherwise noted, all variables in Equation \ref{d_et} are allowed to vary, including uncertainty ($\sigma$). Each column represents a different quantity related to $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$, and each row is a different PFT. Vertical black lines denote where our theory says $VPD_{crit}$ should be. For any observations to the left of this line $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$ should be negative (plant response dominates), and any observations the right of the line should be positive (atmospheric demand dominates). In addition to seeing how our theoretically-derived VPD threshold, $VPD_{crit}$, matches observations, these analysis are also useful for observing how the scaling term affects the magnitude of the derivative, if at all. 

Figure \ref{real} generally confirms expectations from Figure \ref{agu_fig}. By comparing different columns of Figure \ref{real} we can evaluate the impact of $\sigma$ and aerodynamic conductance ($g_a$) on the variability of ET response ($\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$). Aerodynamic conductance's scaling (included in columns 1 and 3) alters the magnitude considerably, particularly between PFTs. $\sigma$ variability (included in columns 1 and 2) adds a lot of additional noise to the signal of $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$, as observed in Figure \ref{agu_fig}. However, the general story with the noise appears to match the cleaner signal when $\sigma$ is held constant and $VPD_{crit}$ is clearly visible. The exceptions are, as discussed above, for GRA and CRO, where the full complexity plots (Columns 1 and 2) do not match well with $\sigma$ held fixed (Columns 3 and 4).

While the stomatal conductance $g_a$ has a large impact on the magnitude of the scaling, temperature, through Clausius-Clapeyron ($\Delta$), does not appear to have as much of an impact in the complete estimation of ET response ($\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$). Therefore, it appears that the absolute magnitude of ($\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$ can be mostly attributed to the sign term, and its direct scaling by aerodynamic conductance. Intuitively this is reasonable; aerodynamic conductance will control how dominant balances at the land surface are communicated to the boundary layer. While $\Delta$ controls the efficiency of latent heat flux in removing heat from the surface, it appears this is a second order term, relative to $g_a$, for scaling ET response. 

In general Figures \ref{agu_fig} and \ref{real} match our expectations. Our $\sigma$-based method of uncertainty propagation blurs the idealized expectations the most for GRA and CRO. We therefore have the most confidence in our conclusion based on Equation \ref{d_et} for PFTs CSH, DBF, and ENF, as the sign of the derivative with uncertainty included matches (to leading order) the story when $\sigma$ is held fixed.

\section{Limitations of theory - very dry soil moisture conditions}
In formulating our theory with Penman Monteith, we implicitly did not account for very dry soil moisture conditions. For the majority of environmental conditions  observed at the eddy covariance sites used here, soil conditions were not extremely dry so that we could assume a constant $uWUE$ and $g_1$. We posit that ecosystems will generally optimize to host plants living in conditions which they evolved for. However, in extreme conditions and drought scenarios soil water content (SWC) could become the limiting factor for ET response to VPD, which our theory does not account for. In addition, low soil moisture conditions themselves increase VPD through land-atmosphere feedback \citep[][]{Bouchet_1963, Morton_1965, Brutsaert_1999, Ozdogan_2006, Salvucci_2013, Gentine_2016, Berg_2016}.

We first note that in our datasets low SWC conditions are very infrequent (MAKE SEPERATE PDF OF SWC?). Within our framework, any systematic bias due to the  failure to account for SWC's effects in very dry conditions should manifest itself in a functional relationship between $\sigma$, our uncertainty measure, and SWC, which is observed at the FLUXNET sites. Examining the relationship between $\sigma$ and SWC will test to what extent our theory breaks down in very dry soil moisture conditions.

If we view $\sigma \cdot uWUE$ as, in addition to a measure of uncertainty, a short time-scale observation of uWUE, we would expect $\sigma \cdot uWUE$ to decrease at low SWC (CITE ZHOU ** which ZHOU shows low uWUE with low SWC). If $\sigma \cdot uWUE$ is a very strong function of SWC, then our theory should be conditioned more strongly on well watered soil conditions. If $\sigma \cdot uWUE$ is weakly a function of SWC, then our theory is more universal and independent of soil moisture conditions.

Indeed, for all PFTs, there is some slight dependence of $\sigma \cdot uWUE$ on SWC, especially at low SWC (Figure \ref{swc}). The portion of observations for which our theory is biased by SWC-limitations varies by PFT, due to the nonlinear threshold at which soil moisture availability limits plant function. For CRO and DBF, soil water content only matters for about the lowest 5\% of observations (each box is 5\% of observations in Figure \ref{swc}). And, CRO, relative to DBF, has a very weak dependence on soil moisture, which is reflective of the high likelihood that CRO sites are optimally irrigated and not water stressed. For ENF, systematic SWC-induced biases in $\sigma \cdot uWUE$ emerge in about the lowest 30\% of SWC conditions. In crontast to ENF, CRO, and DBF, for GRA the relationship between $\sigma \cdot uWUE$ and SWC is more linear and affects a greater portion of observations; about 60\% of observations. Clearly, for GRA soil water frequently impacts plant function and alters ET response, and our theory is limited. It is therefore not suprising that our theory tested poorly againt the data for GRA, relative to ENF, DBF, and GRA (Section \ref{testing}). For all other PFTs occurence of soil mosture impacts was rare enough to not manifest itself in bulk statistics and plots\footnote{note that interpreting the soil moisture dependence for CSH is difficult as their are only two sites for that PFT. So systematic soil moisture relationshps are not apparent in Figure \ref{swc}, but instead blurred by the superposition of the two sites. We argue taht the soil moisture dependence is still there, but we don't have enough statistcs to comment on it}.

The observed dependence of $\sigma \cdot uWUE$ on SWC for GRA would explain the deficiencies of our theory compared to the observations in Section \ref{testing}, specifically the trend back towards negative soil moisture at high VPD. Aforementioned feedbacks between the land surface and the atmosphere, which are not accounted for due to our focus on the one-way response of the land surface to atmospheric conditions, would cause high VPD to be correlated with low SWC \citep[][]{Getine_2016, Berg_2016}. So, at high VPD observations of low SWC are more likely, and this low SWC causes a lower uWUE (ZHOU ET AL **). The lower uWUE at low SWC/high VPD then leads to the observed downturn towards decreasing ET with increasing VPD, and the deviation between our theory (based on a constant uWUE assumption) and observations.

To summarize, our theory is limited by its inability to account for soil water impacts on land surface response, and feedbacks between SWC and VPD. Fortunately, for most PFTs SWC's effect on ET is relatively rare (<30\% of observations) and does not manifest itself in the majority of observations and bulk statistics. However, for GRA SWC has a strong effect decreasing water use efficiency for the majority of the observations. Soil moisture effects explain the deficiencies of our theory in Section \ref{testing}, particularly for GRA.

\section{Conclusions} 

We derived a new form of Penman Monteith using the concept of semi-empirical optimal stomatal regulation \citep{Lin_2015, MEDLYN_2011} and near constant $uWUE$ \citep{Zhou_2015} to remove the stomatal conductance implicit dependence on GPP and ET. With our new form of Penman Monteith we developed a theory for when an ecosystem will tend to reduce or increase ET with increasing VPD, which we evaluated against a range of eddy-covariance data spanning different climates and plant functional types. The goal was to capture the leading order behavior of the system to gain some intrinsic knowledge for its behavior. This intuition can be used to disentangle land atmosphere feedbacks in more complicated scenarios, and will aid interpretation of observations and sophisticated models.

Our theory states that each plant type has a critical VPD below which ET will decrease (plant response dominating) and above which ET will increase (atmospheric demand dominates). We tested our theory using data from FLUXNET 2015, and found that for DBF and CSH the theory succeeds in capturing the leading order behavior. For ENF, the theory succeeds in capturing the leading order behavior for the sign of $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$, but not for magnitude. In contrast, the model does not capture the behavior for eddy-covariance observations of CRO and GRA, which could have been expected, as our theory does not account for large sources of heterogeneity in those plant types, including varying surface roughness, c3 vs c4 photosynthesis, and potential differences in irrigation across sites. Also, our theory does not account for strong soil drying, which non-negligibly alters ET response for GRA. Given these deficiencies for CRO and GRA, we will withhold conclusions on their response to increasing VPD.

For the forest sites (DBF, ENF) the observed environmental VPD approximately straddles the critical VPD, with about half the observations below the critical VPD and half above. However for CSH the environmental VPD never exceeds the critical VPD, and even when uncertainty is included the sign of the derivative is almost always negative (93\% of observations).

Generally speaking, our theory suggests that for a majority of enviornmental VPD conditions, plants will tend to conserve water and reduce ET with increasing VPD. Stomatal regulation and plant physiological response strongly regulates ET, but his regulation does vary by PFT. CROs are the least water conservative, while DBF, ENF, and GRA are progressively more water conservative, with CSH begin the most water conservative (most likely to reudce ET in response to increasing VPD). However, these results are subject to the caveat that our theory's performance is most uncertain for GRA and CRO.

While our theory predicts occurrence of increasing ET with increasing VPD (atmospheric demand dominates), plant regulation is still important even when $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD} > 0$. The magnitude of the ``sign term'' of our theory is always far below what it would be if we only considered the atmospheric demand term (PET). This means that any drought indices or analysis using PET will not capture how the vegetated surface respond and react to increases in atmospheric demand. However, the new uWUE-version of Penman Monteith we derived (Equation \ref{et}) could be used as a complement to PET in drought indices. One could calculate and compare indices  when plant response is ignored (PET) or included (Equation \ref{et}). 

This paper provides novel intuition and quantitate assessment on how the land surface responds to atmospheric drying. This intuition for the response of the land surface response to atmospheric drying is critical first step to disentangling land-atmosphere feedbacks at various scales, from diurnal to seasonal and beyond, and to characterize ET response in a warmer, atmospherically drier, and enriched CO$_2$ world.
