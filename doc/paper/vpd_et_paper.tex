\section{Introduction}\explain{This section needs to be fleshed out, and I definitely need to add more citations}


Answering the question ``When does vapor pressure deficit drive or reduce evapotranspiration?'' is motivated by two potenential but opposing perspectives on the matter. The first persepctive is that increases to vapor pressure deficit (VPD) increases atmospheric demand for water from the land surface, and this drives an increase in evapotranspiration (ET). This perspective is particularly relevant because potential evapotranspiration (PET), which is used in many drought indicies and hydrometeorological studies, only quantifies atmospheric demand effects. However, there is another possible perspective for vegetated surfaces. Plants' stomata have evolved to optimally regulate the exchange of water and carbon, and tend to close in response to increased atmospheric dryness \citep{Ball_1987, Leuning_1990, MEDLYN_2011}.  Therefore, an increase in VPD may actually correspond to a decrease in ET because stomatal closure can cancel the effects of shifts to atmospheric de. So really a question of ``When does VPD drive or reduce ET?'' becomes a question of ``When does plant response or atmospheric demand dominate?.''

Quantifying the plant response to a perturbation to atmospheric VPD increases our understanding of land surface response to shifts in atmospheric conditions. If plant response reduces ET in response to atmospheric drying then soil moisture will be conserved for later ET. An increase in ET in reponse to atmospheric drying will reduce soil moisture, but contribute increased moisenting to the atmosperhere. Understanding the one way response of the land surface to the atmosphere is a critical first step to disentangling land-atmosphere feedbacks. The sign and magnitude of land-surface response drives the co-evolution of the atmosphere and land-surface at many timescales, from diurnal to interdecadal.

Before diving into math and data, we have some prior intuition for how the system might behave. First, whether VPD drives or reduces ET should be a function of plant type. Plants that evolved to conserve water (e.g. arid shrubs) will be more likely to reduce ET with increasing VPD, and plants that have evolved to care little about water (e.g. crops) will be more likely to increase ET with increasing VPD. Additionally, atmospheric conditions must matter as well. At the ecosystem scale there are limits to the strategies plants use to hold water back from the atmosphere. As atmospheric demand for water (VPD) increases, ecosystems will begin to reach their water conservation limits. At this stage any further increase in VPD will most likely drive an increase in ET, because there is little more the plants can do keep water back. 

In order to quantify plant response to perturbations to atmospheric demand for water, we apply a Penman-Monteith framework to eddy-covariance observations spanning various biomes and climates. Section 2 describes the data used, Section 3 derives the framework, Section 4 presents results, and Section 5 discusses conclusions. The goal of this paper is to use reasonable approximations as a tool to increase intuition for plant response to atmospheric drying. This intuition will aid interpretation of observations and full complexity climate models. 

\section{Data}
\label{data}
We use data from FLUXNET2015, including all sites with more than four years of data. Each site's plant functional type (PFT) was classified using the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme vegetation classification scheme (\cite{Loveland_1999}).  Because physical constats used in Section \ref{methods} are only published for five plant functional types (PFTs - see Table \ref{pft}),  only 56 of the 77 sites were used. Figure \ref{map_fig} \explain{map needs to be improved - it's a placeholder for now} presents each site and its plant functional type.

The purpose of this study is to examine ecosystem response to atmospheric drying during the growing season. To accomplish this, we filter and quality control the data using a similiar procedure as \cite{Zhou_2015}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Only measured or highest (``good'') quality gapfilled data, according to qualtiy control flags, are used.
\item To isolate the growing season, we only use days in which the average GPP exceeds 10\% of the observed 95th percentile of GPP for a given site.
\item We remove days with rain and the day following to avoid issues with rain interveption and sensor satruation and high relative humidity (Medlyn et. al. 2017).
\end{itemize}
Additionally, we restrict data to the daytime which is identified when downwelling shortwave radation is greater than 50 W m$^{-2}$ and sensible heat flux is greater than 5 W m$^{-2}$. To further reduce the chance of sensor saturation at high relative humidity, we remove all time steps for which VPD is less than .01 kPa. Timesteps with negative observed GPP or ET are also removed. After these quality control proceedures, 332556 upscaled hourly observations remain. 

\section{Methods}
\label{methods}
The Penman-Monteith equation (hereafter PM) estimates ET as a function of atmospheric and land-surface variables:
\begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
      ET = \frac{\Delta R + g_a \rho_a c_p VPD}{\Delta + \gamma(1 + \frac{g_a}{g_s})},
  \end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

 where variable definitions are given in Table 1. \citet{MEDLYN_2011} developed a model for $g_s$ by combining optimal photosynthesis theory with empirical approaches. The result for leaf-scale stomatal resistance was:

\begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
  g_{l-s} = g_0 + 1.6 \left(1 + \frac{g_1}{\sqrt{VPD}}\right) \frac{A}{c_s}
  \end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

This can be adapted to an ecosystem-scale stomatal resistance by multiplying by leaf area index (LAI) and converting units to m s$^{-1}$:

\begin{linenomath*}
  \label{medlyn}
  \begin{equation}
  g_s = \text{LAI} \frac{R \,T}{P} \left( g_0 + 1.6 \left(1 + \frac{g_1}{\sqrt{VPD}}\right) \frac{A}{c_s}\right)
  \end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

While Equation 3 can be used in PM, it will make analytical work with the function intractable because $A$, net CO$_2$ assimilation, is closely functionally related to ET itself. To remove dependence of ET on $A$ we can use the semi-empirical results of \citet{Zhou_2015}. \citet{Zhou_2015} showed that:

\begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
    \label{uwue}
uWUE = \frac{GPP \cdot \sqrt{VPD}}{ET}
  \end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
is relatively constant across time and space (within plant functional type). If, following \citet{Lin_2015}, we approximate $g_0$ as $0$, we can use uWUE to remove $A$ from $g_s$ in a way that makes PM analytically tractable:

\begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
  g_s = \frac{R \, T}{P} 1.6 \left(1 + \frac{g_1}{\sqrt{VPD}}\right) \frac{uWUE \; ET}{c_s \; \sqrt{VPD}}
  \end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

Note that $uWUE$ is fit on the ecosystem scale in \citet{Zhou_2015} so GPP in \ref{uwue} is really $A\cdot \text{LAI}$. This leads to the cancelation of LAI in addition to uWUE in Equation \ref{medlyn}. Plugging Equation 5 into Equation 1 and rearranging gives:

\begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
    ET = \frac{\Delta R + \frac{g_a\; P}{T} \left( \frac{ c_p VPD}{R_{air}} -  \frac{\gamma c_s \sqrt{VPD} }{ R* \; 1.6\; \text{ uWUE } (1 + \frac{g_1}{\sqrt{VPD}})} \right) }{ \Delta + \gamma}
    \label{et}
  \end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

Given FLUXNET data described in Section \ref{data}, every term in Equation \ref{et} is known. However, our sampling of sites and our focus on the growing season may intoduce some deviations of $uWUE$ from those observed in \citet{Zhou_2015}. Also, we wish to include some measure of uncertainty in our analysis to guide if our many assumptions and simplifications are reasonable. To account for both mean deviations of $uWUE$ and uncertainty, we will introduce an uncertainty parameter $\sigma$ modifying $uWUE$:

\begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
    ET = \frac{\Delta R + \frac{g_a\; P}{T} \left( \frac{ c_p VPD}{R_{air}} -  \frac{\gamma c_s \sqrt{VPD} }{ R* \; 1.6\; \sigma \; \text{ uWUE } (1 + \frac{g_1}{\sqrt{VPD}})} \right) }{ \Delta + \gamma}
    \label{et_sigma}
  \end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

Now, from each FLUXNET observation we can calculate single value of $\sigma$:

\begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
\sigma = - \frac{g_a \gamma c_s \sqrt{VPD} L_v P }{ \left(\text{ ET } ( \Delta + \gamma) - \Delta R - g_a \rho_a c_p VPD\right) 1.6 \; R\; T\; \text{ uWUE } (1 + \frac{g_1}{\sqrt{VPD}})}
    \label{et_sigma}
  \end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

The variablility of $\sigma$ across sites and time will provides some measure of uncertainty in our model, assumptions, as well as the fluxnet observations themselves. To correct for differences in sampling between \cite{Zhou_2015} and our data, we set uWUE such that $\overline{\sigma} = 1$. The variability of $\sigma$ then propogates through any uncertainty to our derivative of Equation \ref{et_sigma}:

\begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial \;  ET}{\partial \; VPD} = \frac{2\; g_a \; P}{T(\Delta + \gamma)}   \left(\frac{ c_p}{R_{air}} -  \frac{\gamma c_s }{1.6 \; R*\; \sigma \; \text{ uWUE }} \left( \frac{2 g_1 + \sqrt{VPD}}{2 (g_1 + \sqrt{VPD})^2}\right) \right)
    \label{d_et}
  \end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

With Equation \ref{d_et} we have provided an analytical franework for ecosystem reponse to atmospheric demand perturbations. There are a few subtelties to taking the derivative in Equation \ref{d_et}: $\Delta$ ($\frac{d e_{s}}{d T}$) and $VPD$ are functionally related, so while taking the derivative we evaluate $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD} = \frac{\partial \; ET} {\partial \; e_s} \frac{\partial \; e_s}{\partial \; VPD} \Big|_{\text{RH fixed}} + \frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; RH} \frac{\partial \; RH}{\partial \; VPD} \Big|_{\text{$e_s$ fixed}}$\explain{Should I take the derivative this way? I think it's more mathematically correct, but it makes the explanation more complicated and only changes the solution by a factor of two.}. $RH$ and $e_s$ are assumed to be approximately orthogonal.



The $VPD$ dependence in Equation \ref{d_et} is a little opaque. However, mean $VPD$ is 1062 Pa, so $\sqrt{VPD}$ is 32.6 Pa$^{1/2}$, which is much less than $g_1$ (with the exception of ENF; Table \ref{pft}). So a series expansion in the limit $\frac{\sqrt{VPD}}{g_1} \to 0$ gives an approximation which makes the functional form more clear: \explain{Should I even include the series expansion?}

\begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial \;  ET}{\partial \; VPD} \approx \frac{g_a \; P}{T(\Delta + \gamma)}   \left(\frac{ c_p}{R_{air}} -  \frac{\gamma c_s }{1.6 \; R*\; \sigma \; \text{ uWUE }} \left( \frac{1}{g_{1}} - \frac{3 \sqrt{VPD}}{2 g_{1}^{2}} + \frac{2 \sqrt{VPD}^{2}}{g_{1}^{3}} - \frac{5 \sqrt{VPD}^{3}}{2 g_{1}^{4}} + \mathcal{O}\left(\left(\frac{\sqrt{VPD}}{g_1}\right)^{4}\right) \right) \right)
    \label{d_et_approx}
  \end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

One final comment on our derivation which will not be discussed further but is relevant for future analysis: if we  approximage $c_s$ at a global mean CO$_2$ concentration, then the RHS of Equation \ref{et} is fully defined using commonly available weather station data and the constants published in \citet{Zhou_2015, Lin_2015}. This then begs the question, why use PET for drought metrics in vegetated areas? It appears a much more physically realistic estimate of ET can be had with the same information reqiured to calculate PET.

\section{Results}
\label{results}

By construction, the variability in the $\sigma$ term (Equation \ref{lai}) contains all model and observational uncertainties. For an observation that perfectly matches our model and constant uWUE assumption $\sigma$ will be one. Therefore, for our assumptions and framework to be reasonable $\sigma$ should be $O(1)$. Figure \ref{lai_fig} presents the histogram of calculated $\sigma$s with outliers removed (lowest and highest 5\% percent). All remaining $\sigma$ values are $O(1)$ which provides confidence in model framework.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=20pc]{./fig02.png}
\caption{Histogram of $\sigma$ values calculated for each site and time according to Equation \ref{lai}. The lowest and highest 5\% are removed as outliers, as well as any values below 0. The curve is normalized such that its area is 1. }
\label{lai_fig}
\end{figure}

An additional concern is that the $\sigma$ term may in fact be some function of $VPD$, in which case the dependence would need to be accounted for when taking the derivative. Figure \ref{lai_vpd_fig} plots the joint distribution of $\sigma$ and VPD, and shows that $\sigma$ is very weakly a function of VPD. Given this weak dependence, we argue that Equation \ref{d_et} is a valid approximation for ET response to $VPD$.

\label{lai_vpd_fig}
\end{figure}

Before calculating the sensitivity of ET to VPD, we will consider the functional form of Equation \ref{d_et}. There are two main terms: a ``scaling'' term which modifies the mangnitude but not the sign:

\begin{equation}
  \frac{g_a \; P}{T(\Delta + \gamma)},
\end{equation}

and a ``sign'' term which determines whether the derivative is postive or negative:

\begin{equation}
  \label{sign}
  \frac{c_p}{R_{air}} - \frac{\gamma c_s }{1.6 \; R\; \text{ uWUE }} \left( \frac{2 g_1 + \sqrt{VPD}}{2 (g_1 + \sqrt{VPD})^2}\right).
\end{equation}
All variables are positive, so the relative magnitude between the first term and the second term in Equation \ref{sign} will deterimine whether ET increases or decreases with increasing VPD. If the second term is larger magnitude then plant response dominates, while if the first term is larger then atmospheric demand dominats. Given that the sign term is crucial to answering our question ``When does VPD drive or reduce ET?'', we will explore its functional form first.

\subsection{Functional Form of the Sign Term}
 
The sign term is crucuial for answering our question ``When does VPD drive or reduce ET?,'' so let's explore the terms within it more. The variability of $c_s$ and $\gamma$ is relatively less than $\sigma$ and $VPD$ variability, so we sign term variability within PFT will approximately determined by just $\sigma$ and $VPD$. If we fix uncertainty $\sigma$ at 1, then the sign term is approximately just a function of $VPD$. We can further dertmine a $VPD_{crit}$ where $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD} = 0$:

\begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
VPD_{crit} = \frac{R_{air}}{4 c_p} \left( \frac{\gamma c_s}{1.6\; R \; \overline{\sigma} uWUE} + \sqrt{\frac{\gamma c_s}{1.6\; R \; \overline{\sigma} uWUE}\left( \frac{\gamma c_s}{1.6\; R \; \overline{\sigma} uWUE} + 8 g_1 \frac{c_p}{R_{air}}\right)} - 4 g_1 \frac{c_p}{R_{air}} \right)
\label{vpd_min_et}
  \end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

Values of $VPD_{crit}$ as a function of PFT are shown in Table \ref{vpd_crit}. For any values of $VPD$ less than $VPD_{crit}$, $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$ will be negative, and for values of $VPD$ greater than $VPD_{crit}$, $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$ will be positive. Intuitively this makes sense; as VPD increases ecosystems will start to run out of strategies to hold back water, and atmospheric demand will increase. Any further increases in atmospheric demand will then result in an increase in VPD. The extent to which a given ecosystem has evolved to conserve water will determine at what VPD atmospheric demand takes over.

For reference, these values are also provided. For values of $VPD$ less than $VPD_{crit}$, $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$ will be negative, and for values of $VPD$ greater than $VPD_{crit}$, $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$ will be positive.}

Figure \ref{term3} provides greater description for how the sign term varies with $VPD$, as a function of PFT. Equation \ref{d_et_approx} aids interpretation of Figure \ref{term3}. Larger $uWUE$ and $g1$ shift the leading-order constant term ($\frac{1}{g_1}$) towards smaller values, and the sign term towards overall positive values. % Higher values corresponde to plants that are more willing to spend water on primary production and less evolved to conserve water.\explain{really need to think about this sentence more, tehre is more nuance and I actually thing g1 and uwue really partially cancel.}
Figure \ref{term3} confirms our physical intuition: CROs are the least water conservative so have the smallest constant portion of Term 3, while CSH are the most water conservative and have the largest constant portion of Term 3. For the VPD-dependent terms in Equation \ref{d_et_approx}, differences in $g1$ between PFTs exert a greater influence than difference $uWUE$, as the power of $g1$ increases. Increasing $uWUE$ and $g1$ decreases the VPD-dependence, but $g1$ has the bigger effect due to its increasing powers. ENF ($g1 = 74.31$) has by far the largest VPD dependence of response, while CRO ($g1 = 183.1$) has the smallest VPD dependence.

Figure \ref{term3}b shows the location of the minima of ET, as a function of $\sigma$ and $VPD$. For any $\sigma$ or VPD less (more) than these curves, the sign term will be negative (positive). It is clear that the portion of VPD observations below/above these curves will be a strong function of $\sigma$. However, we can see some general trends. For CSH, $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$ should be negative for the vast majority of observed $\sigma$ and VPD. The fraction of positive $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$ appears to be more even for ENF, GRA, and DBF, and we might expect a greater frequency of positive $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$ for CRO. 


\subsection{Functional Form of the Scaling Term}

While the above discussion of the sign of $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$ is important to answer our research question, the magnitude of $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$ will also impact statistics of $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$ and the importance of $VPD$ variablility for overall $ET$ variability. So we will more closely examine the scaling term: $\frac{P}{T} \propto \rho$, so this should vary little relative to aerodynamic conductance and $\Delta$. $\gamma$ should also be relatively constant, so the scaling term should be primarily a function of aerodynamic conductance and temperature (through the function $\Delta$). This makes sense, as aerodynamic conductance represents how efficently response at the surface is communicated to the atmosphere. As it increases, any plant response will be communicated more strongly to the atmosphere (and vice-versa).

$\Delta$'s presence in the scaling term also matches physical intition. Evaporative cooling will dampen the ability of the atmosphere to take more moisture, because $e_{s}$ decreases with decreasing temperature. The decrease in $e_{s}$ is proportional to $\Delta$ ($\delta e_{s} = \Delta \delta T$). So as $\Delta$ increases, you will get a larger damping of ET due to evaporative cooling.  The functional from of $\Delta$ will be the same across PFT, but the temperature range may vary slightly. In contrast, aerodynamic conductance will vary strongly with PFT due to the importance of surface roughness. So most of the differences in scaling between PFT should be in the aerodynamic conductance term. One interesting side note is that the coefficient of variability for both aerodynamic conductance and the scaling term is relatively constant across PFT, suggesting that the influence of aerodynamic conductance on the relative (to the PFT mean) variability of the scaling term is approximately similar across PFT.

Figure \ref{scale_vary}A shows scaling term normalized by mean aerodynamic conductance (calculated for each plant functional type), and confirms that much of the relative variability of the scaling term is caused by aerodynamic conductance variability. Generally, temperature (via $\Delta$) causes less relative variability. However, the impact of $T$ on the relative variability increases with increasing aerodynamic conductance. 

While the relative variability of scaling term is similar across PFT, the absolute value of scaling term varies strongly across PFT. Figure \ref{scale_vary}B shows scaling term evaluated with the mean aerodynamic conductance for each PFT, and at the range of observed temperatures for each PFT. As expected, for the tree PFTs (DBF, ENF) the scaling term is much larger and the temperature dependence is much stronger. Systematic differences in observed temperatures also cause differences in the average magnitude of scaling term. For example, ENF experiences on average colder temperatures and is thus more likely to have a larger scaling term. Additionally, because the variability of aerodynamic conductance increases proportionally to the mean, the spread of the scaling term due to aerodynamic conductance variability will be larger for the tree PFTs, although this is not shown for simplicity. To summarize Figure \ref{scale_vary}, the variability of the scaling term within each PFT will look like Figure \ref{scale_vary}A for each PFT, but the scale of the y-axis will increase or decrease according to mean aerodynamic conductance oberved in Figure \ref{scale_vary}B.

\subsection{Bulk statistics of $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$}

Table 3 confirms our expectations for PFT behavior of $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$. For all PFTs except for CRO, average $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$ is less than zero. However, $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$ evaluated at the average of all variables (e.g. $\sigma$, $T$, $c_s$, $VPD$) is only negative for CSH and GRA. And, DBF in addition to CRO experiences $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$ < 0 less than half the time. These observations highlight the effect of the nonlinear function in Figure \ref{term3}: $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$ has a much steeper slope when the function is negative, and is thus more likely to be large magnitude.

The units of $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$ make it difficult to interpret if $VPD$ is even a meaningful contributor to ET's variability. To better understand $VPD$'s contribution, we mulitply $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$ with $VPD$'s standard deviation to define a (linearized) relative change in ET for variations in $VPD$ . $VPD$'s contribution to ET's variability ranges between 30 - 40 W m$^{-2}$ for all PFTs except for CSH, which is about 100 W m$^{-2}$. Another meaningful comparison is to $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; R} \cdot std(R)$, as net radiation is generally the driver of ET (cite joe berry here)\explain{Find citation?}. For all PFTs except for CSH $VPD$ contributes between 30 - 40 \% of $R$'s contribution to variability. For CSH the portion is much larger, about 88 \%. $VPD$'s variability is certiantly a non-negligable contributor to $ET$'s variability.

So far, idealized plots and statistics have illuminated the form of $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$ and how it varies with PFT. Large mean uWUE shifts CRO and DBF towards positive $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$, but $\overline{\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}}$ is still negative for DBF due to its lower $g1$. ENF's low $g1$, even lower than DBF, increases the dependence of $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$ on $VPD$, and makes the function very nonlinear. This has the side effect of pushing $\overline{\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}}$ negative further than other PFTs for a given fraction $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD} < 0$ and magnitude $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}(\overline{T,\ldots,VPD})$. GRA shows the opposite behavior; a relatively high $g1$  makes the function more linear, decreasing the magnitude of $\overline{\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}}$ for a given fraction $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD} < 0$ and negative $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}(\overline{T,\ldots,VPD})$. Finally, the low $uWUE$ of CSH pushes it toward by far the lowest values $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$ (Figure \ref{term3}). Variability in $VPD$ accounts for the largest about of $ET$ variability for CSH. For the other PFTs, $VPD$ contributes less to $ET$ variability, but still represents about 30-40 \% of $R$'s contributions to ET variability.

\subsection{Testing the theory - does the data match the model?}

So far we have developed a theory for $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$'s behavior. Most important to answering ``When does VPD drive or reduce ET?'' is that the sign of our derivative term is correct. So, we need to test if when we include uncertainty the observed derivitives match what our theory would say for the sign term.

Figure \ref{agu_fig} shows the distribution of of the sign term when uncertainty is included, as compared to what the theory says it should be. Our goal for this paper was to capture the leading order behavior and guide intuition. For DBF and CSH our theory is successful towards this goal: the theory matches the leading order behavior of the function when uncertainty is included. Given the assumptions we've made, and the uncertainties of flux tower observations themselves, there will always be a large amount of noise. The plots for DBF and CSH look as one would expect if one just added noise on top of our theory.

The theory does not match as well for CRO and GRA. Perhaps this should be expected. Our theory, for practical reasons, does not include important sources of variablility (particyularly between sites) for CRO and GRA. We do not account for seasonal changes in LAI, variability in crop height and surface roughness, differences in C3 vs C4 photosynthesis, or differences in irrigation practices between the sites. Given that the our thoery does not do as well for CRO and GRA, we will refrain from firm statements about how CRO and GRA respond to changes in VPD.

ENF is a special case. The VPD dependence of the theory is not well captured by observations. However, the theory closely captures the intercept where $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD} = 0$. Resolving this feature is the key to answering our question, so perhaps the theory is still useful for ENF for the purpose of addressing when VPD drives or reduces ET. It is also noteworthy that we used published constants for $g1$, which determines the VPD dependence, from \cite{Lin_2015}. We could have fit our own constants to tweak the theory to match the observations, but our goal was to use a priori physical constants whenever possible..

As stated in the above discussion of ENF, we are mostly interested in the critical threshold $VPD_{crit}$ for which the sign of  $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$ is determined. When $VPD < VPD_{crit}$, $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}  < 0$, and when $VPD > VPD_{crit}$, $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD} > 0$. Theoretically this $VPD_{crit}$ is only a function of PFT. We can look at how this value of $VPD_{crit}$ matches the data as different observed variables (including uncertainty) are allowed to vary.

A final comparison for Figure \ref{agu_fig} is to the value of the sign term for PET. For PET, the sign term is a constant $\frac{c_p}{R_{air}}\approx 3.5$. This is far more than any of the observed values in Figure \ref{agu_fig}, even when uncertainty is included. So, even when atmospheric demand dominates plant response, the plant response still has a large role in attenuating atmospheric demand. In order to understand and capture the behavior of land-surface reponse, representation of the plants must be included in some form. This comparison casts doubt on the usefulness of PET for interprenting land-atmosphere evolution, as is done often in hydrometeorlogical studies.

Figure \ref{real} presents calculated $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$ where, unless otherwise noted, all variables in Equation \ref{d_et} are allowed to vary, including uncertainty. Each column is a different quantity related to $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$, and each row is a different PFT. Vertical black lines denote where our theory says $VPD_{crit}$ should be. For any obervations to the left of this line $\frac{]aprial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$ should be negative, and any ovservations the righ right of the line should be postiive. In addition to seeing how the theory $VPD_{crit}$ matches observations, these plots are also useful for observing how the scaling term affects the magnitude of the derivative, if at all. 

The scatter plots generally confirm expectations from Figure \ref{agu_fig}. By comparing different columns of Figure \ref{real} we can see the impact of $\sigma$ and $g_a$ on the variability of $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$. $g_a$'s scaling (included in columns 1 and 3) alters the magnitude considerably, particularly between PFTs. $\sigma$ variability (included in columns 1 and 2) adds a lot of additional noise to the signal of $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$, as observed in Figure \ref{agu_fig}. However, the general story with the noise appears to match the cleaner signal when $\sigma$ is help constant and $VPD_{crit}$ is clearly visible. The exceptions are, as discussed above, for GRA and CRO, where the full complexity plots (Columns 1 and 2) to not match well with $\sigma$ held fixed (Columns 3 and 4).

While $g_a$ has a large impact on magnitudes in the scaling, temperature, through the $\Delta$ term, does not appear to have as much of an impact in the complete estimation of $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$. Therefore it appears that the absolute magnitude of the derivative can be mostly attributed to the sign term, and its direct scaling by aerodynamic conductance. Intuitively this makes sense; aerodynamic conductance will control how dominant balances at the land surface are communicated to the boundary layer. While $\Delta$ controlls the efficiency of latent fluxes in carying heat away from the surface, it appears this is a second order term, relative to $g_a$, for scaling $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$. 

In general Figures \ref{real} and \ref{agu_fig} match our expectations, even with the large sensitivity to $\sigma$ seen in Figure \ref{term3}. Our $\sigma$-based method of uncertainty propagation blurs the idealized expectations the most for GRA and CRO. We therefor have the most confidence in our conclusion based on Equation \ref{d_et} for PFTs CSH, DBF, and ENF, as the sign of the derivative with uncertainty included matches (to leading order) the story when $\sigma$ is held fixed.

\section{Conclusions} 

We derived a new form of Penman Monteith using $uWUE$ (\cite{Zhou_2015}) to remove implicit depedence on ET in the stomatal conductance term. With our new form of Penman Monteith we deveoped a theory for when an ecosystem will tend to reduce or increase ET with increasing VPD. The goal was to capture the leading order behavior of the stem to gain some intrinsic knowledge for its behaviro. This intuition can be used to disentangle land atmosphere feedbacks in more complicated scenariors, and will aid interpretation of obserations and sophisticated models.

Our theory states that each plant type will have it's own critical VPD below which ET will decrease (plant response dominating) and above which ET will increase (atmospheric demand dominates). We tested our theory using data from FLUXNET 2015, and found that for DBF and CSH the theory succeeds in capturing the leading order behavor. For ENF, the thoery succeeds in capturing the leading order behavior for the sign of $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$, but not for magnitude. In contrast, the model does not capture the behavior for CRO and GRA. In some ways we should have expected this, as our theory does not account for large variability we would expect for those plant types, including varying surface roughness, c3 vs c4 photosynthesis, and potential differences in irrigationa cross sites. Given these diffincies for CRO and GRA, we will withhold conclusions on their response to increasing VPD.

For the forest sites (DBF, ENF) the observed environmental VPD approximately straddles the critical VPD, with about half the observations below the critical VPD and half above. However for CSH the environmental VPD never exceeds the critical VPD, and even when uncertainty is included the sign of the derivative is almost always negative (93\% of observations).

While our theory predicts common occurence of positive $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$ (atmospheric demand dominates), the plant response in attenuating ET from the land surface is still important even when $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD} > 0$. The magnitude of the ``sign term'' of our theory is always far below what it would be if we only considered the atmospheric demand term. This means that any drought indicies or analysis using PET will not capture how the vegetated surface respond and react to increases in atmospheric demand. However, the new uWUE-version of Penman Monteith we derived could be used as a complement to PET in drought indices. Basically one could compare calculate and compare indices  when plant response is ignored (PET) or included (uWUE-Penman Monteith). 

This paper provides the initial intuition for how the land surface respondes to atmospheric drying. This intuition for the one-way behavior of  land surface resonse to atmospheric drying is critical first step to disentangling land-atmosphere feedbacks at various scales, from diurnal to seasonal and beyond.

% Do not use bulleted lists; enumerated lists are okay.

%  EQUATIONS
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% Single-line equations are centered.
% Equation arrays will appear left-aligned.


%If you don't want an equation number, use the star form:
%\begin{eqnarray*}...\end{eqnarray*}

% Break each line at a sign of operation
% (+, -, etc.) if possible, with the sign of operation
% on the new line.

% Indent second and subsequent lines to align with
% the first character following the equal sign on the
% first line.

% Use an \hspace{} command to insert horizontal space
% into your equation if necessary. Place an appropriate
% unit of measure between the curly braces, e.g.
% \hspace{1in}; you may have to experiment to achieve
% the correct amount of space.

%
%  EQUATION NUMBERING: COUNTER
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% You may change equation numbering by resetting
% the equation counter or by explicitly numbering
% an equation.

% To explicitly number an equation, type \eqnum{}
% (with the desired number between the brackets)
% after the \begin{equation} or \begin{eqnarray}
% command.  The \eqnum{} command will affect only
% the equation it appears with; LaTeX will number
% any equations appearing later in the manuscript
% according to the equation counter.
%

% If you have a multiline equation that needs only
% one equation number, use a \nonumber command in
% front of the double backslashes (\\) as shown in
% the multiline equation above.

% If you are using line numbers, remember to surround
% equations with \begin{linenomath*}...\end{linenomath*}

%  To add line numbers to lines in equations:
%  \begin{linenomath*}
%  \begin{equation}
%  \end{equation}
%  \end{linenomath*}
