\section{Introduction}\explain{This section needs to be fleshed out, and I definitely need to add more citations}


Changes to vapor pressure deficit (VPD) alter the atmospheric demand for water from the land surface. Traditionally, atmospheric scientists and hydrometeorologists generally think that an increase in atmospheric demand induces an increases in evapotranspiration (ET) (citations?). This possible misconception developed in part due to the proliferation of studies examing potential ET (PET) rather than estimates of ET itself (citations?).  In contrast, plant physiologists know that stomata have evolved to optimally regulate the exchange of water and carbon, and tend to close in response to increased atmospheric dryness \citep{Ball_1987, Leuning_1990, MEDLYN_2011}.  Therefore, an increase (decrease) in VPD may not correspond to an increase (decrease) in ET because stomatal closure (opening) can cancel the effects of shifts to atmospheric demand.

Quantifying the plant response to a perturbation to atmospheric VPD increases our understanding of land surface response to shifts in atmospheric conditions. If plant response reduces ET in response to atmospheric drying then soil moisture will be conserved. An increase in ET in reponse to atmospheric drying will reduce soil moisture, but contribute increased moisenting to the atmosperhere. Clearly, the sign and magnitude of land-surface responsedrives the co-evolution of the atmosphere and land-surface at many timescales, from diurna to interdecadal.

We hypothesize that for most plant types a common resonse to increase in VPD will actually be a decrease in ET. The excpetion would be plants such as crops that are evolved (or bred) to prioritize gross primary production (GPP) over water conservation. However, for all otehr plants types, our hypothesis calls into question the validity of PET-based drought metrics deceloped by hydrometeorologists and used extensively in operations \citep[e.g. PDSI, P-PET,][]{2002, Alley_1984} \explain{more citations needed, including recent PET climate studies like Jack Scheff}. These metrics ignore the role of plants as gatekeepers for surface water loss to the atmosphere and have limited physical meaning for drought of vegetated land types. Additionally, plants evolved in arid climates should prioritize water conservation and we would expect a very negative ET response to increase in VPD. Therefore, vegetated locations most likely to experience droughts should show the strongest deviation between reality and a PET-based approximation. 

In order to quantify plant response to perturbations to atmospheric demand for water, we apply a Penman-Monteith framework to eddy-covariance observations spanning various biomes and climates. Section 2 describes the data used, Section 3 derives the framework, Section 4 presents results, and Section 5 discusses conclusions. The goal of this paper is to use reasonable approximations as a tool to increase intuition for plant response to atmospheric drying. This intuition will aid interpretation of observations and full complexity climate models. 

\section{Data}
\label{data}
We use data from FLUXNET2015. Because $g_1$ coefficients \citep{Lin_2015} and uWUE were only both available for five plant functional types (PFTs - see Table \ref{pft}),  only 56 of the 77 sites were used. Figure \ref{map_fig} \explain{map needs to be improved - it's a placeholder for now} presents each site and its plant functional type.

\section{Methods}
n
The Penman-Monteith equation (hereafter PM) estimates ET as a function of atmospheric and land-surface variables:
\begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
      ET = \frac{\Delta R + g_a \rho_a c_p VPD}{\Delta + \gamma(1 + \frac{g_a}{g_s})},
  \end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

 where variable definitions are given in Table 1. \citet{MEDLYN_2011} developed a model for $g_s$ by combining optimal photosynthesis theory with empirical approaches. The result for leaf-scale stomatal resistance was:

\begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
  g_{l-s} = g_0 + 1.6 \left(1 + \frac{g_1}{\sqrt{VPD}}\right) \frac{A}{c_s}
  \end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

This can be adapted to an ecosystem-scale stomatal resistance by multiplying by leaf area index (LAI) and converting units to m s$^{-1}$

\begin{linenomath*}
  \label{medlyn}
  \begin{equation}
  g_s = \text{LAI} \frac{R \,T}{P} \left( g_0 + 1.6 \left(1 + \frac{g_1}{\sqrt{VPD}}\right) \frac{A}{c_s}\right)
  \end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

While Equation 3 can be used in PM, it will make analytical work with the function intractable because $A$ is a function of ET itself. To remove dependence of ET on $A$ we can use the semi-empirical results of \citet{Zhou_2015}. \citet{Zhou_2015} showed that:

\begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
    \label{uwue}
uWUE = \frac{GPP \cdot \sqrt{VPD}{ET}
  \end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
is relatively constant across time and space (within plant functional type). If, following \citet{Lin_2015}, we approximate $g_0$ as $0$, we can use uWUE to remove $A$ from $g_s$ in a way that makes PM analytically tractable:

\begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
  g_s = \frac{R \, T}{P} 1.6 \left(1 + \frac{g_1}{\sqrt{VPD}}\right) \frac{uWUE \; ET}{c_s \; \sqrt{VPD}}
  \end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

Note that $uWUE$ is fit on the ecosystem scale in \citet{Zhou_2015} so GPP in \ref{uwue} is really $A\cdot \text{LAI}$. This leads to the cancelation of LAI in addition to uWUE in Equation \ref{medlyn}. Plugging Equation 5 into Equation 1 and rearranging gives:

\begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
    ET = \frac{\Delta R + \frac{g_a\; P}{T} \left( \frac{ c_p VPD}{R_{air}} -  \frac{\gamma c_s \sqrt{VPD} }{ R* \; 1.6\; \text{ uWUE } (1 + \frac{g_1}{\sqrt{VPD}})} \right) }{ \Delta + \gamma}
    \label{et}
  \end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

Given FLUXNET data described in Section \ref{data}, every term in Equation \ref{et} is known. However, our sampling of sites and our focus on the growing season may intoduce some deviations of $uWUE$ from those observed in \citet{Zhou_2015}. Also, we wish to include some measure of uncertainty in our analysis to guide if our many assumptions and simplifications are reasonable. To account for both mean deviations of $uWUE$ and uncertainty, we will introduce an uncertainty parameter $\sigma$ modifying $uWUE$:

\begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
    ET = \frac{\Delta R + \frac{g_a\; P}{T} \left( \frac{ c_p VPD}{R_{air}} -  \frac{\gamma c_s \sqrt{VPD} }{ R* \; 1.6\; \sigma \; \text{ uWUE } (1 + \frac{g_1}{\sqrt{VPD}})} \right) }{ \Delta + \gamma}
    \label{et_sigma}
  \end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

Now, from each FLUXNET observation we can calculate single value of $\sigma$:

\begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
\sigma = - \frac{g_a \gamma c_s \sqrt{VPD} L_v P }{ \left(\text{ ET } ( \Delta + \gamma) - \Delta R - g_a \rho_a c_p VPD\right) 1.6 \; R\; T\; \text{ uWUE } (1 + \frac{g_1}{\sqrt{VPD}})}
    \label{et_sigma}
  \end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

The variablility of $\sigma$ across sites and time will provides some measure of uncertainty in our model, assumptions, as well as the fluxnet observations themselves. Mean shifts in $\sigma$ can be attributed to differences in out sampling from those used to calcualte $uWUE$ in \citet{Zhou_2015}. The influence of $\sigma$ will propogate through any uncertainty to our derivative of Equation \ref{et_sigma}:

\begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial \;  ET}{\partial \; VPD} = \frac{2\; g_a \; P}{T(\Delta + \gamma)}   \left(\frac{ c_p}{R_{air}} -  \frac{\gamma c_s }{1.6 \; R*\; \sigma \; \text{ uWUE }} \left( \frac{2 g_1 + \sqrt{VPD}}{2 (g_1 + \sqrt{VPD})^2}\right) \right)
    \label{d_et}
  \end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

With Equation \ref{d_et} we have provided an analytical franework for ecosystem reponse to atmospheric demand perturbations. There are a few subtelties to taking the derivative in Equation \ref{d_et}: $\Delta$ ($\frac{d e_{s}}{d T}$) and $VPD$ are functionally related, so while taking the derivative we evaluate $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD} = \frac{\partial \; ET} {\partial \; e_s} \frac{\partial \; e_s}{\partial \; VPD} \Big|_{\text{RH fixed}} + \frac{\partial \; ET}{partial \; RH} \frac{\partial \; RH}{\partial \; VPD} \Big|_{\text{$e_s$ fixed}}$. $RH$ and $e_s$ are assumed to be approximately orthogonal.



The $VPD$ dependence in Equation \ref{d_et} is a little opaque. However, mean $VPD$ is 1062 Pa, so $\sqrt{VPD}$ is 32.6 Pa$^{1/2}$, which is much less than $g_1$ (with the exception of ENF; Table \ref{pft}). So a series expansion in the limit $\frac{\sqrt{VPD}}{g_1} \to 0$ gives an approximation which makes the functional form more clear: \explain{Should I even include the series expansion?}

\begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial \;  ET}{\partial \; VPD} \approx \frac{g_a \; P}{T(\Delta + \gamma)}   \left(\frac{ c_p}{R_{air}} -  \frac{\gamma c_s }{1.6 \; R*\; \sigma \; \text{ uWUE }} \left( \frac{1}{g_{1}} - \frac{3 \sqrt{VPD}}{2 g_{1}^{2}} + \frac{2 \sqrt{VPD}^{2}}{g_{1}^{3}} - \frac{5 \sqrt{VPD}^{3}}{2 g_{1}^{4}} + \mathcal{O}\left(\left(\frac{\sqrt{VPD}}{g_1}\right)^{4}\right) \right) \right)
    \label{d_et_approx}
  \end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

One final comment on our derivation which will not be discussed further but is relevant for future analysis: if we  approximage $c_s$ at a global mean CO$_2$ concentration, then the RHS of Equation \ref{et} is fully defined using commonly available weather station data and the constants published in \citet{Zhou_2015, Lin_2015}. This then begs the question, why use PET for drought metrics in vegetated areas? It appears a much more physically realistic estimate of ET can be had with the same information reqiured to calculate PET.

We restrict our analysis to the daytime (sensible heat > 5 W m$^{-1}$ and shortwave radiation > 50 W m$^{-2}$) when there is no precipitation and the plants are growing (GPP > 10\% of the 95th percentile) \explain{This GPP thresholding was used by Changjie, do you know if there is a citation for it? Otherwise it seems like something a reviewer would have issue with as it is arbitray}. Also, because some sites use half hourly data but some use hourly, we aggregate all data to hourly averages. Only times with good quality control flags are used.

\section{Results}
\label{results}

By construction, the variability in the $\sigma$ term (Equation \ref{lai}) contains all model and observational uncertainties. For an observation that perfectly matches our model and assumptions $\sigma$ will be one. Therefore, if for our assumptions and framework to be reasonable $\sigma$ should be $O(1)$. Figure \ref{lai_fig} presents the histogram of calculated $\sigma$s with outliers (lowest and highest 5\% percent) and nonphysical values ($\sigma$ $<$ 0.) removed. All remaining $\sigma$ values are $O(1)$ which provides confidence in model framework.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=20pc]{./fig02.png}
\caption{Histogram of $\sigma$ values calculated for each site and time according to Equation \ref{lai}. The lowest and highest 5\% are removed as outliers, as well as any values below 0. The curve is normalized such that its area is 1. }
\label{lai_fig}
\end{figure}

An additional concern is that the $\sigma$ term may in fact be some function of $VPD$, in which case the dependence would need to be accounted for when taking the derivative. Figure \ref{lai_vpd_fig} plots the joint distribution of $\sigma$ and VPD, and shows that $\sigma$ is very weakly a function of VPD. Given this weak dependence, we argue that Equation \ref{d_et} is a valid approximation for ET response to $VPD$.

\label{lai_vpd_fig}
\end{figure}

Before calculating the sensitivity of ET to VPD, it is useful to consider the functional form of Equation \ref{d_et}. There are three terms: a scaling term for the full expression we will call Term 1 ($\frac{g_a \; P}{T(\Delta + \gamma)}$), a relatively constant offset we will call Term 2 ($\frac{c_p}{R_{air}}$), and a variable term we will call Term 3 ($\frac{\gamma c_s }{1.6 \; R\; \text{ uWUE }} \left( \frac{2 g_1 + \sqrt{VPD}}{2 (g_1 + \sqrt{VPD})^2}\right)$). All variables are positive, so the relative magnitude between Term 2 and Term 3 will determine the sign of the derivative, while Term 1 will scale the expression larger or smaller.


Term 2 minus Term 3's role in determining the sign of the sensitivty of ET to VPD makes it crucuial for answering our question ``When does VPD drive or reduce ET?'' Exploring these terms more, $c_s$ and $\gamma$ variability is relatively less than $\sigma$ and $VPD$ variability, so variability within PFT will be solely determined by $\sigma$ and $VPD$. If we fix uncertainty $\sigma$ at PFT averages, then Term 2 minus Term 3 is just a function of $VPD$. We can further dertmine a $VPD_{crit}$ where $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD} = 0$:

\begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
VPD_{crit} = \frac{R_{air}}{4 c_p} \left( \frac{\gamma c_s}{1.6\; R \; \overline{\sigma} uWUE} + \sqrt{\frac{\gamma c_s}{1.6\; R \; \overline{\sigma} uWUE}\left( \frac{\gamma c_s}{1.6\; R \; \overline{\sigma} uWUE} + 8 g_1 \frac{c_p}{R_{air}}\right)} - 4 g_1 \frac{c_p}{R_{air}} \right)
\label{vpd_min_et}
  \end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

Values of $VPD_{crit}$ as a function of PFT are shown in Table \ref{vpd_crit}. For any values of $VPD$ less than $VPD_{crit}$, $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$ will be negative, and for values of $VPD$ greater than $VPD_{crit}$, $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$ will be positive.

For reference, these values are also provided.

Figure \ref{term3} provides greater description for how (Term 2 - Term 3) varies with $VPD$, as a function of PFT. Equation \ref{d_et_approx} aids interpretation of Figure \ref{term3}. Larger $uWUE\cdot\overline{\sigma}$, and $g1$ shift the leading-order constant term ($\frac{1}{g_1}$) towards smaller values, and (Term 2 - Term 3) towards positive values. $uWUE$ and $g1$ are both water-use effiency type constants. Higher values corresponde to plants that are more willing to spend water on primary production and less evolved to conserve water. Figure \ref{term3} confirms our physical intuition: CROs are the least water conservative so have the smallest constant portion of Term 3, while CSH are the most water conservative and have the largest constant portion of Term 3. For the VPD-dependent terms in Equation \ref{d_et_approx}, differences in $g1$ between PFTs exert a greater influence than difference $uWUE$, as the power of $g1$ increases. Increasing $uWUE$ and $g1$ decreases the VPD-dependence, but $g1$ has the bigger effect due to its increasing powers. ENF ($g1 = 74.31$) has by far the largest VPD dependence of response, while CRO ($g1 = 183.1$) has the smallest VPD dependence.

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{term3}b shows the location of the minima of ET, as a function of $\sigma$ and $VPD$. For any $\sigma$ or VPD less (more) than these curves, Term 2 - Term 3 will be negative (positive). It is clear that the portion of VPD observations below/above these curves will be a strong function of $\sigma$. However, we can see some general trends. For CSH, $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$ should be negative for the vast majority of observed $\sigma$ and VPD. The fraciton of positive $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$ appears to be more even for ENF, GRA, and DBF, and we might expect a greater frequency of positive $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$ for CRO. 

While the above discussion of the sign of $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$ is important to answer our research question, the magnitude of $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$ will also impact statistics of $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$ and the importance of $VPD$ variablility for $ET$ variability. So we will more closely examine the scaling Term 1: $\frac{P}{T} \propto \rho$, so this should vary little relative to aerodynamic conductance and $\Delta$. $\gamma$ should also be relatively constant, so Term 1 should be primarily a function of aerodynamic conductance and temperature (through the function $\Delta$). This makes sense, as aerodynamic conductance represents how efficently response at the surface is communicated to the atmosphere. As it increases, any plant response will be communicated more strongly to the atmosphere (and vice-versa).

$\Delta$'s presence in the scaling term also matches physical intition. Evaporative cooling will dampen the ability of the atmosphere to take more moisture, because $e_{s}$ decreases with temperature. The decrease in $e_{s}$ is proportional to $\Delta$ ($\delta e_{s} = \Delta \delta T$). So as $\Delta$ increases, you will get a larger damping of ET due to evaporative cooling.  The functional from of $\Delta$ will be the same across PFT, but the temperature range may vary slightly. In contrast, aerodynamic conductance will vary strongly with PFT due to the importance of surface roughness. So most of the differences in scaling between PFT should be in the aerodynamic conductance term. One interesting side note is that the coefficient of variability for both aerodynamic conductance and Term 1 is relatively constant across PFT, suggesting that the influence of aerodynamic conductance on the relative (to the PFT mean) variability of Term 1 is approximately similar across PFT.

Figure \ref{scale_vary}A shows Term 1 normalized by mean aerodynamic conductance (calculated for each plant functional type), and confirms that much of the relative variability of Term 1 is contained in the aerodynamic conductance variability. Generally, $T$ has less of a role. Additionally, the impact of $T$ on the relative variability increases with increasing aerodynamic conductance. \explain{plot every PFT and show they collapse onto the same curve? - might just be too messy though}.

While the relative variability of Term 1 is similar across PFT, the absolute value of Term 1 varies strongly across PFT. Figure \ref{scale_vary}B shows Term 1 evaluated with the mean aerodynamic conductance for each PFT, and at the range of observed temperatures for each PFT. As expected, for the tree PFTs (DBF, ENF) Term 1 is much larger and the temperature dependence is much stronger. Systematic differences in observed temperatures also cause differences in the average magnitude of Term 1. For example, ENF experiences on average colder temperatures and is thus more likely to have a larger scaling term. Additionally, because the variability of aerodynamic conductance increases proportionally to the mean, the spread of Term 1 due to aerodynamic conductance variability will be larger for the tree PFTs, although this is not shown for simplicity. To summarize, the variability of Term 1 within each PFT will look like Figure \ref{scale_vary}A for each PFT, but the scale of the y-axis will increase or decrease according to mean aerodynamic conductance oberved in Figure \ref{scale_vary}B.

\subsection{Bulk statistics of $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$}

Table 3 confirms our expectations for PFT behavior of $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$. For all PFTs except for CRO, average $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$ is less than zero. However, $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$ evaluated at the average of all variables (e.g. $\sigma$, $T$, $c_s$, $VPD$) is only negative for CSH and GRA. And, DBF in addition to CRO experiences $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$ < 0 less than half the time. These observations highlight the effect of the nonlinear function in Figure \ref{term3}: $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$ has a much steeper slope when the function is negative, and is thus more likely to be large.

The units of $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$ make it difficult to interpret if $VPD$ is even a meaningful contributor to ET's variability. To better understand $VPD$'s contribution, we normalize $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$ with $VPD$'s standard deviation to define a (linearized) relative change in ET for variations in $VPD$ . $VPD$'s contribution to ET's variability ranges between 30 - 40 W m$^{-2}$ for all PFTs except for CSH, which is about 100 W m$^{-2}$. Another meaningful comparison is to $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; R} \cdot std(R)$, as net radiation is generally the driver of ET (cite joe berry here). For all PFTs except for CSH $VPD$ contributes between 30 - 40 \% of $R$'s contribution to variability. For CSH the portion is much larger, about 88 \%. $VPD$'s variability is certiantly a primary contributor to $ET$'s variability.

So far, idealized plots and statistics have illuminated the form of $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$ and how it varies with PFT. Large mean $\sigma$ and uWUE shifts CRO and DBF towards positive $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$. However, the strongly nonlinear function of $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$ at $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD} < 0$ pushes $\overline{\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}}$ negative for DBF (it does not do this for CRO because of CRO's high $g1$). ENF's low $g1$ value increases the dependence of $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$ on $VPD$, and makes the function more strongly nonlinear. This has the side effect of pushing $\overline{\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}}$ negative further than other PFTs for a given fraction $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD} < 0$ and magnitude $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}(\overline{T,\ldots,VPD})$. GRA shows the opposite behavior; a relatively high $g1$  makes the function more linear, decreasing the magnitude of $-\overline{\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}}$ for a given  [large] fraction $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD} < 0$ and negative $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}(\overline{T,\ldots,VPD})$ (although aerodynamic conductance and Term 1 also probably have a role in this). Finally, low $uWUE$ of CSH pushes to toward by far the lowest values $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$ (Figure \ref{term3}). Variability in $VPD$ accounts for the largest about of $ET$ variability for CSH. For the other PFTs, $VPD$ contributes less to $ET$ variability, but still represents about 15-20 \% of $R$'s contributions to ET variability.

\subsection{Testing the theory - does the data match the model?}

So far we have developed a theory for $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$'s behavior. In particular, we determined a critical threshold $VPD_{crit}$ for $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$. For $VPD < VPD_{crit}$, $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}  < 0$, and for $VPD > VPD_{crit}$, $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD} > 0$. This $VPD_{crit}$ is only a function of PFT. However, many assumptions, including constant uWUE, were made in deriving $VPD_{crit}$. So, we need to test if our theory and $VPD_{crit}$ hold up in the face of uncertainty.

Figure \ref{real} presents calculated $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$ where, unless otherwise noted, all variables in Equation \ref{d_et} are allowed to vary, including uncertainty. Each column is a different quantity related to $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$, and each row is a different PFT. 

The full observations generally confirm expectations from Section \ref{results}. CRO has the most positive values of $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$, $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$ is almost always negative for CSH, and response depends more with the environmental conditions for the other PFTs (especially ENF). Through the columns of Figure \ref{real} we can see the impact of $\sigma$ and $g_a$ on the variability of $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$. $g_a$'s scaling (included in columns 1 and 3) alters the magnitude considerably. $\sigma$ variability (included in columns 1 and 2) adds a lot of additional noise to the signal of $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$, which is slightly undesirable given $\sigma$'s role in representing model and observational uncertainty. However, the general story with the noise appears to match the cleaner signal when $\sigma$ is help constant and $VPD_{crit}$ is clearly visible. One exception is possibly with GRA, for which uncertainty represented in $\sigma$ is high and causes the full complexity plots (Columns 1 and 2) to not match well with $\sigma$ held fixed (Columns 3 and 4).

For ENF and GRA $VPD_{crit}$ does not appear to be only a function of $\sigma$ (most observable in Column 4). It turns out that the site to site variability in $\gamma$ causes $VPD_{crit}$ to vary, which is not discussed in the previous section. The impact is observable in both ENF and GRA, but especially for ENF which has a larger $\frac{\partial^2 \; ET}{\partial^2 \; VPD}$ than the other PFTs. 

In general the full complexity plots of $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$ match our expectations, even with the large sensitivity to $\sigma$ measures of uncertainty observed in Figure \ref{term3}. Our $\sigma$-based method of uncertainty propagation blurs the idealized expectations the most for GRA, and also has a considerable effect for CRO. We therefor have the most confidence in our conclusion based on Equation \ref{d_et} for PFTS CSH, DBF, and ENF, as the full complexity plots with uncertainty included closely match the story when $\sigma$ is held fixed. **see somewhat preferred alternate figure \ref{real2} \explain{I think I like the alternate plot much  more as thinking in terms of T and RH is easier, and it makes the story easier to see at relatively low temperatures. However, I used the other plot because Fig 5 does not discuss things in terms of temperature, as this would make things more complicated (adding another dimension). I could just include both versions of figure 6 though (using figure 6a as a bridge to figure 6b)}.

\section{Conclusions} \explain{also need to flesh this section out}

The idealized representation of ET used here is successful in developing intuition for how ET responds to changes in $VPD$. This intuition will aid the community in interpreting observations and output from sophisticated full complexity climate models.

The idealized framework leads to the following general conclusions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Aerodynamic resistance plays an important role of scaling $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$. This is a leading order effect for observing higher magnitude responses in DBF and ENF.
  \item In general, CSH has the most negative (i.e. ET reduced) response to increases in $VPD$ (atmospheric drying). So CSH plants will almost always try and conserve water, effectively reducing ET with dry atmospheric perturbation.
    \item Additionally for CSH, $VPD$ variability contributes the most to $ET$ variability.
\item CRO has the most positive response (i.e. ET increased) in response to increases in $VPD$. This is consistent with CROs that may be evolved or bred to thrive in non-water-limited environments.
\item The response is more a function of the environment for DBF, ENF, and GRA. Because as VPD increases the response is more likely to be positive, if RH is fixed then the response will be more likely to be positive at warmer T, or if T is fixed the response is more likely to be positive with decreasing RH.
\item ENF has the strongest dependence on environmental conditions due to its small $g1$.
\item Model and observational uncertainty is highest for GRA and CRO, so conclusions about those PFTs should be tempered.
\item However, inclusion of uncertainty doesn't alter conclusions about DBF, ENF, and CSH.
\end{itemize}

The intuition developed using this framework can be used to understand how the land surface will respond and contribute to changes in the environment. Additionally, Equation \ref{et} gives provides an estimate of ET that requires no additional information beyond that required to calculate PET. Given that for all PFTs, with the exception of CRO, we found a high frequency and magnitude of negative $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial \; VPD}$, PET is a physically unrealisitic representation of ET for vegetated surfaces and PET-based drought metrics are not usefull. We advocate for drought metrics using Equation \ref{et} instead of PET.
