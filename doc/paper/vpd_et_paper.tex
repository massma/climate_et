\section{Introduction}\explain{This section needs to be fleshed out, and I definately need to add more citations}

Changes to vapor pressure deficit (VPD) alter the atmospheric demand for water from the land surface. However, plant stomata have evolved to optimally regulate the exchange of water and carbon between vegetation and the atmosphere \citep{Franks_2017}. Therfore, an increase (decrease) in VPD may not correspond to an increase (decrease) in evapotranspiration (ET) because stomatal closure (opening) can cancel the effects of shifts to atmospheric demand.

Quantifying the plant response to a perturbation to atmospheric VPD increases our understanidng of feedbacks between the land surface and the atmosphere. If plant reponse reduces ET in response to an increase in VPD, the land surface will contribute a positive feedback in reponse to atmospheric drying. Conversely, if plant response increases ET in response to increase in VPD, then the land surface will contribute a negative feedback to atmospheric drying. The sign of these feedbacks drives the evolution of the atmosphere and landsurface at many timescales, from diurnal to interdecadal. 

Here we use a Penman-Monteith framework to quantify plant reponse to perturbations to atmospheric demand for water. Section 2 derives the framework, Section 3 describes the data used, Section 4 presents results, and Section 5 discusses conclusions.

\section{Methods}

The Penman-Monteith equation (hereafter PM) estimates ET as a function of atmospheric and land-surface variaibles:

\begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
      ET = \frac{\Delta R + g_a \rho_a c_p D_{s}}{\Delta + \gamma(1 + \frac{g_a}{g_s})},
  \end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

 where variable definitions are given in Table 1. \cite{MEDLYN_2011} developed a model for $g_s$ by combining optimal photosynthesis theory with empiracle approaches. The result for leaf-scale stomatal resistance was:

\begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
  g_{l-s} = g_0 + 1.6 \left(1 + \frac{g_1}{\sqrt{D_{s}}}\right) \frac{A}{c_s}
  \end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

This can be adapted to an ecosystem-scale stomatal resistance by multiplying by leaf area index (LAI) and converting units to m s$^{-1}$:
\begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
  g_s = \text{LAI } \frac{R* T}{P} \left( g_0 + 1.6 \left(1 + \frac{g_1}{\sqrt{D_{s}}}\right) \frac{A}{c_s}\right)
  \end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

While Equation 3 can be used in PM, it will make analytical work with the function intractable because $A$ is a relatively strong function of ET. To remove dependence of ET on $A$ we can use the semi-impiracle results of \cite{Zhou_2015}. \cite{Zhou_2015} showed that:

\begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
uWUE = \frac{GPP \cdot \sqrt{D}}{ET}
  \end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
is relatively constant across time and space (within plant functional type). If, following \cite{Lin_2015}, we approximate $g_0$ as $0$, we can use uWUE to remove $A$ from $g_s$ in a way that makes PM analytically tractable:

\begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
  g_s = \text{LAI } \frac{R* T}{P} 1.6 \left(1 + \frac{g_1}{\sqrt{D_{s}}}\right) \frac{uWUE \; ET}{c_s \; \sqrt{D}}
  \end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

Plugging Equation 5 into Equation 1 and rearranging gives:

\begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
  ET = \frac{\Delta R + \frac{g_a\; P}{T} \left( \frac{ c_p D_{s}}{R_{air}} - \frac{\gamma c_s \sqrt{D} }{\text{LAI } R* \; 1.6 \text{ uWUE } (1 + \frac{g_1}{\sqrt{D}})} \right) }{ \Delta + \gamma}
  \end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

We can then take the derivative with respect to $D$ to determine ecosystem reponse to atmospheric demand perturbations:

\begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \;  ET}{\partial \; D} = \frac{g_a \; P}{T(\Delta + \gamma)}   \left(\frac{ c_p}{R_{air}} - \frac{\gamma c_s }{\text{LAI }1.6 \; R\; \text{ uWUE }} \left( \frac{2 g_1 + \sqrt{D}}{2 (g_1 + \sqrt{D})^2}\right) \right)
  \end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}
Note that given yearly uWUE from \cite{Zhou_2015}, $g_1$ from \cite{Lin_2015} \citep[as presented in ][]{Franks_2017}, and observations of R, T, P, D$_s$, and wind speed (WS), the only unknown is LAI. With flux tower observations of ET, LAI will then be uniquely determined for each observation through Equation 6:

\begin{linenomath*}
  \begin{equation}
LAI  = - \frac{g_a \gamma c_s \sqrt{D_s} P }{ \left(\text{ ET } ( \Delta + \gamma) - \Delta R - g_a \rho_a c_p D_{s}\right) 1.6 \; R\; T\; \text{ uWUE } (1 + \frac{g_1}{\sqrt{D_s}})}
  \end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

This ``pseudo-LAI'' is some part ``true'' LAI (a measure of leaf area), and some part model and observational error, including error involving our assumption of constant uWUE. By calculating a unique LAI for each observation we will progate any model and observational uncertainty forward into our expression for $\frac{\partial \; ET}{\partial D}$.

\section{Data}

We use data from FLUXNET2015. Because $g_1$ coefficients \citep{Lin_2015} and uWUE were only both available for five plant functional types (PFTs - see Table 2),  only 56 of the 77 sites were used. Figure 1 presents each site and its plant functional type.


\begin{table}
\caption{Plant functional types, their abbreviation, Medlyn coefficient \citep[from ][]{Lin_2015}, and uWfUE \citep[from ][]{Zhou_2015}. Note that units are converted such that the quantities fit into Equations 1-8 with the variables in Table 1.}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l c c c}
  \hline
  Abbreviation & PFT & $g_1$ (Pa$^{0.5}$) & uWUE ($\mu$-mol [C] Pa$^{0.5}$ J$^{-1}$ [ET])  \\
  \hline
  CRO & cropland & 183.1 & 3.80 \\
  CSH & closed shrub & 148.6 & 2.18 \\
  DBF & deciduous broadleaf forest & 140.7 & 3.12 \\
  ENF & evergreen needleleaf forest & 74.3 & 3.30 \\
  GRA & grassland (C3) & 166.0 & 2.68 \\
\hline
\multicolumn{2}{l}{$^{a}$Footnote text here.}
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

We restrict our analysis to the daytime (sensible heat > 5 W m$^{-1}$ and shortwave radiation > 50 W m$^{-2}$) when there is no precipitation and the plants are growing (GPP > 10\% of the 95th pecentile). Also, because some sites use half hourly data but some use hourly, we aggregate all data to hourly averages. Only times with good quality control flags are used.
