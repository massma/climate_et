    abstract = { Abstract The complementary relationship between actual and potential evaporation over southeastern Turkey was examined using a mesoscale climate model and field data. Model simulations of both actual and potential evaporation produce realistic temporal patterns in comparison to those estimated from field data; as evaporation from the surface increases with increasing irrigation, potential evaporation decreases. This is in accordance with the Bouchetâ€“Morton complementary relationship and suggests that actual evapotranspiration can be readily computed from routine meteorological observations. The driving mechanisms behind irrigation-related changes in actual and potential evaporation include reduced wind velocities, increased atmospheric stability, and depressed humidity deficits. The relative role of each in preserving the complementary relation is assessed by fitting a potential evaporation model to pan evaporation data. The importance of reduced wind velocity in maintaining complementarity was unexpected, and thus examined further using a set of perturbation simulation experiments with changing roughness parameters (reflecting growing cotton crops), changing moisture conditions (reflecting irrigation), and both. Three potential causes of wind velocity reduction associated with irrigation may be increased surface roughness, decreased thermal convection that influences momentum transfer, and the development of anomalous high pressure that counteracts the background wind field. All three are evident in the mesoscale model results, but the primary cause is the pressure-induced local wind system. The apparent necessity of capturing mesoscale dynamical feedbacks in maintaining complementarity between potential and actual evaporation suggests that a theory more complicated than current descriptions (which are based on feedbacks between actual evaporation and temperature and/or humidity gradients) is required to explain the complementary relationship. }

	abstract = {The ability to predict terrestrial evapotranspiration (E) is limited by the complexity of rate-limiting pathways as water moves through the soil, vegetation (roots, xylem, stomata), canopy air space, and the atmospheric boundary layer. The impossibility of specifying the numerous parameters required to model this process in full spatial detail has necessitated spatially upscaled models that depend on effective parameters such as the surface vapor conductance (Csurf). Csurf accounts for the biophysical and hydrological effects on diffusion through the soil and vegetation substrate. This approach, however, requires either site-specific calibration of Csurf to measured E, or further parameterization based on metrics such as leaf area, senescence state, stomatal conductance, soil texture, soil moisture, and water table depth. Here, we show that this key, rate-limiting, parameter can be estimated from an emergent relationship between the diurnal cycle of the relative humidity profile and E. The relation is that the vertical variance of the relative humidity profile is less than would occur for increased or decreased evaporation rates, suggesting that land{\textendash}atmosphere feedback processes minimize this variance. It is found to hold over a wide range of climate conditions (arid{\textendash}humid) and limiting factors (soil moisture, leaf area, energy). With this relation, estimates of E and Csurf can be obtained globally from widely available meteorological measurements, many of which have been archived since the early 1900s. In conjunction with precipitation and stream flow, long-term E estimates provide insights and empirical constraints on projected accelerations of the hydrologic cycle.},

	abstract = {We show that the water savings that plants experience under high CO2 conditions compensate for much of the effect of warmer temperatures, keeping the amount of water on land, on average, higher than we would predict with common drought metrics, and with a different spatial pattern. The implications of plants needing less water under high CO2 reaches beyond drought prediction to the assessment of climate change impacts on agriculture, water resources, wildfire risk, and vegetation dynamics.Rising atmospheric CO2 will make Earth warmer, and many studies have inferred that this warming will cause droughts to become more widespread and severe. However, rising atmospheric CO2 also modifies stomatal conductance and plant water use, processes that are often are overlooked in impact analysis. We find that plant physiological responses to CO2 reduce predictions of future drought stress, and that this reduction is captured by using plant-centric rather than atmosphere-centric metrics from Earth system models (ESMs). The atmosphere-centric Palmer Drought Severity Index predicts future increases in drought stress for more than 70\% of global land area. This area drops to 37\% with the use of precipitation minus evapotranspiration (P-E), a measure that represents the water flux available to downstream ecosystems and humans. The two metrics yield consistent estimates of increasing stress in regions where precipitation decreases are more robust (southern North America, northeastern South America, and southern Europe). The metrics produce diverging estimates elsewhere, with P-E predicting decreasing stress across temperate Asia and central Africa. The differing sensitivity of drought metrics to radiative and physiological aspects of increasing CO2 partly explains the divergent estimates of future drought reported in recent studies. Further, use of ESM output in offline models may double-count plant feedbacks on relative humidity and other surface variables, leading to overestimates of future stress. The use of drought metrics that account for the response of plant transpiration to changing CO2, including direct use of P-E and soil moisture from ESMs, is needed to reduce uncertainties in future assessment.},

    abstract = { AbstractThe aridity of a terrestrial climate is often quantified using the dimensionless ratio of annual precipitation (P) to annual potential evapotranspiration (PET). In this study, the climatological patterns and greenhouse warming responses of terrestrial P, Penmanâ€“Monteith PET, and are compared among 16 modern global climate models. The large-scale climatological values and implied biome types often disagree widely among models, with large systematic differences from observational estimates. In addition, the PET climatologies often differ by several tens of percent when computed using monthly versus 3-hourly inputs.With greenhouse warming, land P does not systematically increase or decrease, except at high latitudes. Therefore, because of moderate, ubiquitous PET increases, decreases (drying) are much more widespread than increases (wetting) in the tropics, subtropics, and midlatitudes in most models, confirming and expanding on earlier findings. The PET increases are also somewhat sensitive to the time resolution of the inputs, although not as systematically as for the PET climatologies.The changes in the balance between P and PET are also quantified using an alternative aridity index, the ratio , which has a one-to-one but nonlinear correspondence with . It is argued that the magnitudes of changes are more uniformly relevant than the magnitudes of changes, which tend to be much higher in wetter regions. The ratio and its changes are also found to be excellent statistical predictors of the land surface evaporative fraction and its changes. }

    abstract = { AbstractSurface temperatures increase at a greater rate over land than ocean in simulations and observations of global warming. It has previously been proposed that this landâ€“ocean warming contrast is related to different changes in lapse rates over land and ocean because of limited moisture availability over land. A simple theory of the landâ€“ocean warming contrast is developed here in which lapse rates are determined by an assumption of convective quasi-equilibrium. The theory predicts that the difference between land and ocean temperatures increases monotonically as the climate warms or as the land becomes more arid. However, the ratio of differential warming over land and ocean varies nonmonotonically with temperature for constant relative humidities and reaches a maximum at roughly 290 K.The theory is applied to simulations with an idealized general circulation model in which the continental configuration and climate are varied systematically. The simulated warming contrast is confined to latitudes below 50Â° when climate is varied by changes in longwave optical thickness. The warming contrast depends on land aridity and is larger for zonal land bands than for continents with finite zonal extent. A landâ€“ocean temperature contrast may be induced at higher latitudes by enforcing an arid land surface, but its magnitude is relatively small. The warming contrast is generally well described by the theory, although inclusion of a landâ€“ocean albedo contrast causes the theory to overestimate the land temperatures. Extensions of the theory are discussed to include the effect of large-scale eddies on the extratropical thermal stratification and to account for warming contrasts in both surface air and surface skin temperatures. }

However, these factors are seldom assessed together as compound events, although they often occur simultaneously. Drought stress on terrestrial carbon uptake is characterized by soil moisture (SM) deficit and high vapor pressure deficit (VPD). We used in situ observations and 15 Earth system models to show that compound events with very high VPD and low SM occur more frequently than expected if these events were independent. These compound events are projected to become more frequent and more extreme and exert increasingly negative effects on continental productivity. Models project intensified negative effects of high VPD and low SM on vegetation productivity, with the intensification of SM exceeding those of VPD in the Northern Hemisphere. These results highlight the importance of compound extreme events and their threats for the capability of continents to act as a carbon sink.",

Other studies reached identical results, yet assumed different forms for the underlying functions and defined the daily cost parameter as carbon cost per unit water. We demonstrated that the solution can be recovered when optimization is formulated at time scales commensurate with the response time of g to environmental stimuli. The optimization theory produced three emergent gas exchange responses that are consistent with observed behaviour: (1) the sensitivity of g to vapour pressure deficit (D) is similar to that obtained from a previous synthesis of more than 40 species showing g to scale as 1â€ƒâˆ’â€ƒmâ€ƒlog(D), where mâ€ƒ?â€ƒ[0.5,0.6], (2) the theory is consistent with the onset of an apparent â€˜feed-forwardâ€™ mechanism in g, and (3) the emergent non-linear relationship between the ratio of intercellular to atmospheric [CO2] (ci/ca) and D agrees with the results available on this response. We extended the theory to diagnosing experimental results on the sensitivity of g to D under varying ca.",

The Noah-MP's performance is evaluated at various local sites using high temporal frequency data sets, and results show the advantages of using multiple optional schemes to interpret the differences in modeling simulations. The second paper focuses on ensemble evaluations with long-term regional (basin) and global scale data sets. The enhanced conceptual realism includes (1) the vegetation canopy energy balance, (2) the layered snowpack, (3) frozen soil and infiltration, (4) soil moisture-groundwater interaction and related runoff production, and (5) vegetation phenology. Sample local-scale validations are conducted over the First International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP) Field Experiment (FIFE) site, the W3 catchment of Sleepers River, Vermont, and a French snow observation site. Noah-MP shows apparent improvements in reproducing surface fluxes, skin temperature over dry periods, snow water equivalent (SWE), snow depth, and runoff over Noah LSM version 3.0. Noah-MP improves the SWE simulations due to more accurate simulations of the diurnal variations of the snow skin temperature, which is critical for computing available energy for melting. Noah-MP also improves the simulation of runoff peaks and timing by introducing a more permeable frozen soil and more accurate simulation of snowmelt. We also demonstrate that Noah-MP is an effective research tool by which modeling results for a given process can be interpreted through multiple optional parameterization schemes in the same model framework.",

However, current representations vary markedly between TBMs, contributing uncertainty to projections of global carbon fluxes. Here we compared the representation of photosynthesis in seven TBMs by examining leaf and canopy level responses of photosynthetic CO2 assimilation (A) to key environmental variables: light, temperature, CO2 concentration, vapor pressure deficit and soil water content. We identified research areas where limited process knowledge prevents inclusion of physiological phenomena in current TBMs and research areas where data are urgently needed for model parameterization or evaluation. We provide a roadmap for new science needed to improve the representation of photosynthesis in the next generation of terrestrial biosphere and Earth system models.",

    abstract = "Optimization theories explain a variety of forms and functions in plants. At the leaf scale, it is often hypothesized that carbon gain is maximized, thus providing a quantifiable objective for a mathematical definition of optimality conditions. Eco-physiological trade-offs and limited resource availability introduce natural bounds to this optimization process. In particular, carbon uptake from the atmosphere is inherently linked to water losses from the soil as water is taken up by roots and evaporated. Hence, water availability in soils constrains the amount of carbon that can be taken up and assimilated into new biomass. The problem of maximizing photosynthesis at a given water availability by modifying stomatal conductance, the plant-controlled variable to be optimized, has been traditionally formulated for short time intervals over which soil moisture changes can be neglected. This simplification led to a mathematically open solution, where the undefined Lagrange multiplier of the optimization (equivalent to the marginal water use efficiency, Î») is then heuristically determined via data fitting. Here, a set of models based on different assumptions that account for soil moisture dynamics over an individual dry-down are proposed so as to provide closed analytical expressions for the carbon gain maximization problem. These novel solutions link the observed variability in Î» over time, across soil moisture changes, and at different atmospheric CO2 concentrations to water use strategies ranging from intensive, in which all soil water is consumed by the end of the dry-down period, to more conservative, in which water stress is avoided by reducing transpiration.",

    abstract = "The problem of areally averaging descriptions of land-atmosphere energy and mass exchange is common to both the leaf-canopy and canopy-region scale translations. This paper attempts a unified treatment. The starting point is a review of both the basic and equilibrium-departure forms of the Penman-Monteith or combination equation (CE) for the latent and sensible heat fluxes at an evaporating surface; the equilibrium-departure form expresses the evaporation as a linear combination of two other scalar fluxes, those of available energy and saturation deficit. Next, tools for scale translation are established, including (1) the basic conservation requirement that net scalar fluxes average linearly over the land surface and (2) the matching of model form between scales. These tools are applied to the CE for latent and sensible heat fluxes FE and FH, leading to a â€˜flux matchingâ€™ averaging scheme based on term-by-term matching of the linearly additive scalar flux terms in the CE for FE. Several variations of this scheme are discussed. For FE, all variations satisfy the scalar conservation requirement that fluxes average linearly, but for FH, none satisfies this requirement exactly, except when long-wave radiative coupling is ignored. By considering a range of canopy-region scale translations, errors in the averaging of FH are shown to be small in practice. Finally, three averaging schemes (the flux-matching scheme and two schemes based on parallel sums of elemental aerodynamic and surface conductances, respectively) are compared for leaf-canopy scale translations, by constructing a sequence of analytic model canopies at increasing levels of detail. For every canopy model considered, all three averaging schemes give nearly identical definitions of the bulk canopy conductance for typical dry canopies. However, schemes other than the flux matching scheme can become inconsistent over partially wet surfaces, yielding undefined or negative bulk conductances.",

    abstract = "ABSTRACT Responses of stomatal conductance (gs) to increasing vapour pressure deficit (D) generally follow an exponential decrease described equally well by several empirical functions. However, the magnitude of the decrease â€“ the stomatal sensitivity â€“ varies considerably both within and between species. Here we analysed data from a variety of sources employing both porometric and sap flux estimates of gs to evaluate the hypothesis that stomatal sensitivity is proportional to the magnitude of gs at low D (â‰¤ 1 kPa). To test this relationship we used the function gs=gsrefâ€“mÂ· lnD where m is the stomatal sensitivity and gsref=gs at D= 1 kPa. Regardless of species or methodology, m was highly correlated with gsref (average r2= 0Â·75) with a slope of approximately 0Â·6. We demonstrate that this empirical slope is consistent with the theoretical slope derived from a simple hydraulic model that assumes stomatal regulation of leaf water potential. The theoretical slope is robust to deviations from underlying assumptions and variation in model parameters. The relationships within and among species are close to theoretical predictions, regardless of whether the analysis is based on porometric measurements of gs in relation to leaf-surface D (Ds), or on sap flux-based stomatal conductance of whole trees (GSi), or stand-level stomatal conductance (GS) in relation to D. Thus, individuals, species, and stands with high stomatal conductance at low D show a greater sensitivity to D, as required by the role of stomata in regulating leaf water potential.",

    abstract = "ABSTRACT This study tests two predictions from a recently proposed model for stomatal responses to humidity and temperature. The model is based on water potential equilibrium between the guard cells and the air at the bottom of the stomatal pore and contains three independent variables: gs0, Z and Î˜. gs0 is the value of stomatal conductance that would occur at saturating humidity and will vary among leaves and with CO2 and light. The value of Z is determined primarily by the resistance to heat transfer from the epidermis to the evaporating site and the value of Î˜ is determined primarily by the resistance to water vapour diffusion from the evaporating site to the guard cells. This leads to the two predictions that were tested. Firstly, the values of Z and Î˜ should be constant for leaves of a given species grown under given conditions, although gs0 should vary among leaves and with light and CO2. And secondly, the ratio of Z to Î˜ should be higher in leaves having their stomata in crypts because the distance for heat transfer is greater than that for water vapour diffusion. Data from three species, Nerium oleander, Pastinaca sativum and Xanthium strumarium support these two predictions.",

    abstract = "ABSTRACT Stomata play a key role in plant adaptation to changing environmental conditions as they control both water losses and CO2 uptake. Particularly, in the context of global change, simulations of the consequences of drought on crop plants are needed to design more efficient and water-saving cropping systems. However, most of the models of stomatal conductance (gs) developed at the leaf level link gs to environmental factors or net photosynthesis (Anet), but do not include satisfactorily the effects of drought, impairing our capacity to simulate plant functioning in conditions of limited water supply. The objective of this review was to draw an up-to-date picture of the gs models, from the empirical to the process-based ones, along with their mechanistic or deterministic bases. It focuses on models capable to account for multiple environmental influences with emphasis on drought conditions. We examine how models that have been proposed for well-watered conditions can be combined with those specifically designed to deal with drought conditions. Ideas for future improvements of gs models are discussed: the issue of co-regulation of gs and Anet; the roles of CO2, absissic acid and H2O2; and finally, how to better address the new challenges arising from the issue of global change.",

When the vapour pressure deficit of the air around a single leaf in a cuvette was varied from 10 to 30 Pa kPa-1 in 5 Pa kPa-1 steps, while holding the remainder of the plant at a vapour presure deficit of 10 Pa kPa-1, the leaf conductance and net photosynthetic rate of the leaf decreased in all species. The rate of transpiration increased initially with increase in vapour pressure deficit in all species, but in several species a maximum transpiration rate was observed at 20 to 25 Pa kPa-1. Concurrent measurements of the leaf water potential by in situ psychrometry showed that an increase in the vapour pressure deficit decreased the leaf water potential in all species. The decrease was greatest in woody species, and least in herbaceous species. When the vapour pressure deficit around the remainder of the plant was increased while the leaf in the cuvette was exposed to a low and constant vapour pressure deficit, similar responses in both degree and magnitude in the rates of transpiration and leaf conductance were observed in the remainder of the plant as those occurring when the vapour pressure deficit around the single leaf was varied. Increasing the external vapour pressure deficit lowered the water potential of the leaf in the cuvette in the woody species and induced a decrease in leaf conductance in some, but not all, speies. The decrease in leaf conductance with decreasing water potential was greater in the woody species when the vapour pressure deficit was increased than when it remained low and constant, indicating that changing the leaf-to-air vapour pressure difference had a direct effect on the stomata in these species. The low hydraulic resistance and maintenance of a high leaf water potential precluded such an analysis in the herbaceous species. We conclude that at least in the woody species studied, an increase in the vapour pressure deficit around a leaf will decrease leaf gas exchange through a direct effect on the leaf epidermis and sometimes additionally through a lowering of the mesophyll water potential.",

Photosynthesis and stomatal and internal diffusion resistances of whole, attached, single leaves were not affected by changes in humidity as the vapour pressure deficit between the leaf and atmosphere ranged from 8 to 27 mb. Transpiration increased linearly with increasing vapour pressure deficit. Whole plants of barley exhibited a different response. As humidity was increased, photosynthesis increased, transpiration expressed per unit of vapour pressure difference increased, and diffusion resistances became smaller. Reasons for the different behaviour of single leaves and whole plants are suggested. An index for water use efficiency, expressed per millibar of vapour pressure deficit, was calculated for single leaves of each species used in the experiments. This showed that water use efficiency was highest in the C4 xerophytes and lowest in the C3 mesophytes. The effect of environment on water use efficiency is examined using data from the literature.",

The stomatal response to humidity for a given surface was found to be the same whether or not the humidity for the opposite surface was changed concurrently. Stomata on the surface for which humidity was constant showed no response to changes in humidity for the opposite surface. Despite large changes in epidermal turgor on the surface for which humidity was changed, there was no change in epidermal turgor for the surface with constant humidity. Measurements of transpiration and epidermal turgor as functions of the mole fraction gradient of water between leaf and air were used to calculate a value for leaf hydraulic resistance. The results suggest that in these species, the mechanism for the stomatal response to humidity resides in the epidermis or the mesophyll very close to the epidermis, and that most of the hydraulic resistance of the leaf occurs between the xylem and the evaporating sites.",
