Vapor pressure deficit (VPD) is expected to rise over continents in
the future due to the combination of increased temperature and,
depending on region, decreased relative humidity
\citep{Byrne_2013}. Increases in VPD increase the atmospheric demand
for evapotranspirated water \citep{Penman_1948, Monteith_1965}, but
also stress plant stomata \citep{Leuning_1990, MEDLYN_2011}.

The opposing effects of increased atmospheric demand and higher
stomatal stress lead to two possible perspectives for how
evapotranspiration (ET) responds to shifts in VPD. The first, a
hydrometeorological perspective, is that higher VPD increases
atmospheric demand for water from the land surface, and this drives an
increase in evapotranspiration (ET). This perspective is particularly
relevant because potential evapotranspiration (PET), which is used in
many drought indices and hydrometeorological studies
\citep[e.g.,][]{Heim_2002, Scheff_2015}, typically only quantifies
changes in atmospheric demand and fails to account for ecosystem
response \citep{Swann_2016}. In reality, plants' stomata have evolved
to optimally regulate the exchange of water and carbon, and tend to
partially close in response to increased atmospheric dryness
\citep{Farquhar_1978, Ball_1987, Leuning_1990, MEDLYN_2011}. This
leads to a plant physiology perspective, in which an increase in VPD,
particularly in well-watered soil conditions, may actually correspond
to a decrease in ET because of stomatal closure
\citep[e.g.][]{Rigden_2017}.  In other words, the question ``When does
VPD drive or reduce ET?'' can be related to whether plant regulation
or atmospheric demand dominates ET response.

The ET response to changes in VPD alters water partitioning between
the soil and atmosphere. If ecosystem plant response reduces ET with
atmospheric drying then soil moisture will be better conserved. This
would seem a sensible evolutionary strategy to cope with aridity. If
stomata were fully passive \citep [similar to soil pores,
e.g. ][]{Or_2013}, increased atmospheric aridity would strongly reduce
soil moisture \citep{Berg_2017}. In turn, this would further increase
aridity as low soil moisture levels increase the Bowen ratio, and
cause increased temperature and atmospheric drying
\citep[][]{Bouchet_1963, Morton_1965, Brutsaert_1999, Ozdogan_2006,
  Salvucci_2013, Gentine_2016, Berg_2016}. This however would not seem
to be a sensible strategy for plants from an evolutionary
standpoint. As a counterpoint, one may argue that increases in ET with
increasing VPD could increase the likelihood of precipitation
\citep[e.g.,][]{Findell_2011}. However, increases in ET do not always
guarantee an increased likelihood of precipitation, which depending on
environmental conditions could cause a decrease in the likelihood of
precipitation \citep[][]{Gentine_2013}. Furthermore, any increases in
precipitation are likely to be non-local, such that plants giving up
water to the atmosphere are not guaranteed to reap the benefits of
water returned from the atmosphere to the soil. Using this subjective
logic, from an ecosystem evolutionary perspective, water stored in
soil seems to be worth much more than the chance of water returned as
precipitation.

We can use intuition about plant water conservation strategy to
hypothesize about ET response to changes in VPD. Plants and ecosystems
that evolved to conserve water, such as arid shrubs or savannah,
should be more likely to reduce ET with increasing VPD, and plants
that have evolved or have been engineered to care little about water,
such as crops, will be more likely to increase ET with increasing
VPD. Atmospheric conditions must matter as well. At the ecosystem
scale, there are limits to plant water conservation strategies. As
atmospheric demand for water (VPD) increases, ecosystems should begin
to reach their water conservation limits and might not be able to
entirely limit ET flux to the atmosphere. At this stage any further
increase in VPD will most likely drive a (limited) increase in ET,
because the increase in atmospheric demand for water overwhelms the
limited plant response to conserve water.

The objective of the present manuscript is to use reasonable
approximations as a tool to develop intuition for plant response to
atmospheric drying and evaluate the VPD dependence of ET. This
intuition will aid interpretation of observations, full complexity
models, and facilitate the disentanglement of complex land-atmosphere
feedbacks. In the past, similar approaches were used to understand
interactions between stomatal conductance, evapotranspiration and the
environment \citep[e.g.,][]{Jarvis_1986, Mcnaughton_1991}. However, at
the time researchers' understanding of the form of VPD's effect on
plant physiology was limited, so they could not explore the
sensitivity of ET to VPD, including VPD's effect on stomatal
conductance and plant function.

Recent results have drastically improved our understanding of VPD's
impact on physiology, especially at the leaf
level. \citet{MEDLYN_2011} developed a model for leaf-scale stomatal
conductance ($g_s$), including VPD response, by combining an optimal
photosynthesis theory \citep{Cowan_1977} with an
empirical approach, and extended use of this model to the ecosystem
scale in \citet{Medlyn_2017}. Additionally, \citet{Zhou_2014}
demonstrated that a quantity underlying water use efficiency
$\left(uWUE = \frac{GPP\; \sqrt{VPD}}{ET}\right)$ properly captures a
constant relationship between GPP, ET, and VPD over a diurnal cycle at
the ecosystem scale. uWUE is also remarkably well conserved in the
growing season across space and time, within a PFT
\citep{Zhou_2015}. These results provide novel tools to examine how ET
varies in response to VPD, while explicitly including VPD's effect on
stomatal conductance for the first time. In this manuscript, we
leverage these tools to derive the theoretical one-way response of ET
to VPD with other environmental variables properly controlled for,
i.e. we develop a framework for evaluating the partial derivative of
ET with respect to VPD. Our theory is validated and tested at multiple
eddy-covariance stations spanning various climates and plant
functional types.
