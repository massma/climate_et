Plants can sense increasing dryness in the air and close up the pores
on their leaves, preventing water loss. However, drier air also
naturally demands more water from the land surface. Here we develop a
simplified theory for when land surface water loss increases
(atmospheric demand dominates) or decreases (plant response dominates)
in response to increased dryness in the air. This theory provides
intuition for how ecosystems regulate water in response to changes in
atmospheric dryness.
