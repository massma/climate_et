This is a directory where derived data from my collaborator, Changjie
Lin, will be downloaded. These data were to big to host on github.

It is extremely important that these data are only used for the
purposes of reproducing this research, for two good reasons. First,
FLUXNET data for new research should be optained from the FLUXNET
website to insure that the data policy is followed and FLUXNET is
aware of the downloads. Second, only a portion of the data in the
tarball are actually used in the analysis, and any of the other
variables may not be reliable, quality controlled, or correct.
