# orginally from Bonan et. al 2002 "The Land Surface Climatology..."
# note that they have more classes, but these were identical, so condensed to the
# coarser PFTs used in the other tables
# units: , , m, unitless,unitless,unitless,unitless, m
# also note that I added some roughness lengths from the WRF USGS summer tables
