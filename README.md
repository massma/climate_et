## Overview ##

The goal of this project is to test:

1. When is VPD a driver or reducer of ET?

2. What will drive ET changes with climate? Previous studyies (e.g. Jack Scheff's papers) used PET, but the story will be different with ET because of the ecosystem resistances. For example, if you include temperature effect on the g<sub>sto</sub> term in Penman-Monteith you will see it cancel a lot of the CC scaling observed in PET. So in reality ET changes as a function of temperature might be more mild, but we need to test this (which is the purpose of this project).
